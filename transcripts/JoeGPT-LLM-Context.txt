So how this whole thing began is I was in central Florida and I was sitting on the side of the road

like in front of a gas station and someone came up and tipped me $100 and I was like wow thanks

and I thought what's the most productive thing I can get with this because you know it was very

rare I'd see $100 and I'd been homeless for three years at that point and so I went and got this

tablet which I now I'm messing around with Linux on it which is what brought it up and I went and

these were $60 at Walmart. It was the cheapest thing I could get that had a screen and a camera

and I instantly put TikTok on it and it took me forever to start uploading. I started

just recording pictures like birds and at the pond and stuff like that all while sleeping on

the street and using this thing for like Wi-Fi and TikTok and nothing that great.

For a while I thought well I've wasted my money I'm not gonna be able to pull this off so I just

kept working on it and working on it and finally on the side of the road upload a video of myself

and then the whole thing started and that was probably two years ago now but this poor tablet

its battery has been through like a thousand cycles or more. It used to last like 10 hours

per charge so I'd charge it using an outdoor power outlet and then sit on TikTok or think up

video ideas because I didn't expect to get picked up as quick as I did. The first video I recorded

of my face I got picked right up and got a place but I wasn't expecting that to happen so I was

expecting to just be recording myself in the brush showing what my lifestyle was like but the thing

went off instantly and I wasn't going to turn down a hotel room so that was like two years ago and

I'm still getting like my face is still chewed up so I haven't quite got everything clean yet

but this tablet has been an absolute workhorse. Where I got the idea from was I used to play

this old video game called Stalker Shadows of Chernobyl and the tablet in it you would bring

it up and you would have like navigation and all like the quests you could do and stuff like that

on it so that I thought that was a really good idea you know if you get stranded out you know

anywhere and you need a basic communication device then that tablet seemed like the best

one to go with and it sure is what worked for me but I had been using it for about a year before

I got like the gear to click over where I was able to record myself and upload a video to TikTok

successfully and then go from there but anyway stay tuned!

So, as I've said before, I was certified to scuba dive in Flagstaff, Arizona, and then went scuba

diving at a few lakes in Arizona and down in Cancun, Mexico, just south of Cancun, Mexico.

So, I think that certification still holds. I would have to renew it or something, but

after looking into space so much, I decided the whole thing was just too much fight,

and they're probably all a lot smarter than I am, so I'm staying out of it. The other thing

I really got interested in was scuba diving, and it's kind of running on the same principle,

except it's under the water, but also very underexplored and has some different challenges

to spaceflight, because in a spaceship or international space station, you know, whatever,

everything's under really low pressure. So, because it's a vacuum of space, you know,

you're trying to keep the air in, whereas under the ocean, it's under really high pressure.

So, everything has to be held out really well, and going down into deep-sea dives,

which I barely know anything about, the hulls of the submarines they send down there

have to be really strong to withstand all the pressure in the ocean. It almost makes it more

difficult to build one than building a spaceship, because it just requires so much rigidity to hold

off all that pressure. So, I've been looking around at it. It's another thing to just explore.

I'm always kind of looking for places to explore, and both space and the bottom of the ocean are two

things that haven't been explored by humans that much. And when I say space, I mean like low Earth

orbit and Mars and Saturn's rings. Nothing like way out there. But under the ocean is so much

easier, because you don't need that rocket to launch up in the air, and you have to go through

so many resources to launch the thing, and then how many people are getting mad at you for using

what you're using to go up there. So, that's got me back on the ocean kick, and I can't remember

which I enjoyed more, but both scuba diving at the bottom of lakes and scuba diving at the ocean were

awesome. The bottom of the lakes, they were murky, but you could go see like boats that had sunk,

just lake boats that sunk 50 years ago, and all sorts of artifacts people lost in the lake,

you could dig up at the bottom. So, that was a lot of fun. The ocean, this was in the Gulf of Mexico.

There was so much wildlife down there, like turtles, sharks, all the reef fish swimming around.

So, it was really pretty and really, really immaculate. There was no trash or debris or

litter or anything down near Cancun, which really made it bright and colorful and beautiful.

So, I think the job in the ocean would be preserving the wildlife habitats,

whereas the job scuba diving at the bottom of lakes would be just looking for junk people lose

and kind of doing treasure hunting in lakes. So, I don't know. I'll keep researching it. Stay tuned.

So, uh, when I go to get groceries, I don't have a car.

So I just use a backpack and some, uh, reusable bags.

And it seems to be the direction everyone wants to be going in. Um,

because for a while, uh,

the store charged to use plastic bags and that did me a favor cause, uh,

I was using the backpack, so I wasn't using plastic bags anyway,

but it seems to be encouraged to not use plastic as much as possible.

So the backpack really works. Um, and I can carry quite a bit, uh,

probably 40 or 50 pounds, uh, and go about a mile. Uh,

I could walk farther, but, uh,

that's how far I have to walk to get groceries. But, uh,

the, uh,

the conflict I'm going through is the interaction between

pedestrians and cars. Uh, there's like no pedestrians on the road.

So, uh, or on the sidewalk. So, uh, the,

uh, the, the cars are everywhere.

And it always seems like whenever you're walking anywhere, um,

the cars are kind of gunning for you. And I don't know what's causing that.

I started going through like, uh,

the animal or the whole thing. Like, uh,

because the car is bigger and heavier,

it's just scary for a pedestrian trying to walk. Um,

and what the mindset is of both sides of the, the situation.

Um, because, uh, uh,

it's much more difficult, uh, being a pedestrian, uh,

and trying to walk with traffic around, you really have to keep your, your, uh,

your, uh,

what's the word I'm looking for? Um, uh,

surroundings, uh, in check. Uh,

so, uh, having to dodge cars the whole way is not fun.

That's the worst part of the whole thing. But, uh,

I wish we could live in a world where, uh,

we had smaller, lighter cars and you could have easier pedestrian

mobility, uh, even not quite pedestrian, you know, scooters, uh,

motorcycles, those little electric wheelchairs like in, uh, in Wally,

you know how they had screens with lazy boy chairs that would just float around

and that was their transportation. Uh,

that sure would say solve a lot of this grief between, uh,

pedestrians and cars. And, uh,

another thing is part of the reason there is no pedestrians is because cars are,

are everywhere. And like, no one's walking. Um,

I'm like one of three people that's usually out there, uh,

when I'm walking across some distance. Uh, but, uh,

if you know,

all of human civilization could go in that direction on this smaller,

lighter transportation, uh, it sure,

it would save resources. It would save metal. And, uh,

everyone would get to where they need to go without causing a lot of grief for

whatever thing is out there, uh, trying to get by.

So, uh, anyway, stay tuned.

Well, I don't know what it is, but I'm finding myself more and more reluctant to go outside.

I'm so comfortable in this room after spending so much time outdoors. I really like it indoors.

So I don't know if, as I'm clearing up issues my parents created, that it's just

less and less need to go outside. But also, walking with the traffic everywhere is causing

concern. I don't want to upset anyone, and because I'm the only person out there walking,

maybe people driving around get upset about pedestrians.

So I'm trying to avoid as much conflict as possible.

And staying indoors sure does seem to do that. But I don't get as good of content. You know,

you just get stuff of me standing here telling some story that maybe people find interesting.

Whereas outdoors I did get a little more scenery to capture. But once I get some

form of transportation, I'll try to get more events and shows and interesting

content to put on this channel. So anyway, stay tuned.

So I've been watching the phone industry go through its cycles and I've been

using this BlueView 2 phone. It's cheap and does its job for like 30 bucks I

think and it's like six dollars a month for the service and I just run the thing

on Wi-Fi all the time so I don't have to worry about data. At least that much. I

mean the Wi-Fi is intermittent but it does work. So I've been using these

things for years. I have two of them. The only issue I've had is some of the

quality control could be better. I had a first one and the battery

started overheating so I got a second one and the second one the camera

wouldn't focus so I put the new battery from the second one in the old phone and

that kept going which is another benefit to these is you can replace the battery

so I can just swap batteries out and keep going which brings the price way

down from what like conventional phones cost and I just saw Samsung released a

Samsung Mini S23 that's in the same ballpark in price range. It's like $35

and smaller than this one but the whole market seems to be like swaying to all

bigger screens and now they're trying this new one with a small screen

whereas this form right here has always seemed to be the most successful to me. I

mean whatever this size is I don't know what the screen size is but they change

it around and like it doesn't work you know it goes away from the formula that

was successful in the first place. So I'm gonna continue sticking with this

size phone. I wish the camera was a little sharper. This is the camera on it

I'm recording. I've been recording all these videos on this phone so not bad

for $30. Anyway stay tuned.

So I had to make this clip outdoors because the walls are paper thin in my apartment hotel.

So any noise I make in there just reverberates through everything. So at night I can't like

make any noises whatsoever and I have to come outside which is a total pain. I've been pulling

it off for the longest time just being completely silent and just like watching movies and playing

Doom and doing stuff like that. But you know tonight you know I slept all day so I'm up all

night and I have to be completely quiet in the room so I had to come outside. And the one place

I can go is this little pond. There's not a lot going on with the thing. I was hoping to get to

see some wildlife and be able to record it but there's nothing out here tonight. I've seen

raccoons and I mean there was a few ducks you know maybe something I could get footage of but

nothing that exciting. So anyway stay tuned.

So, uh, I'm back to being close to no money whatsoever and, uh, uh, like ways to, uh,

earn a living because my face is clear and I've gotten cleaned up considerably. Well,

mostly clear, you know, I still have a few outbreaks here and there, but, uh,

uh, now I'm trying to find ways to make money and I'm still kind of stuck in the, uh, in the rut

of, uh, sitting on the side of the road. So I'm out walking right now trying to, uh,

think about which course to take. Um, I have a really good story from all this,

but, uh, I've been writing it on the laptop, just typing it in and I'm at about 50 pages.

With a, uh, professional writer, I could probably get a good story or book out to, uh,

out to be published, but I don't know what the first step to that is.

And I don't know how good my writing is to begin with. So, uh, once I find a way to get proof for

it, I can do that, but that doesn't solve my money problems right now. So I'm just out walking it out,

trying to, uh, trying to think it through. Um, I'm, uh, I'm browsing around, you know,

stuff I've done before because I was in Las Vegas for so long. Uh, I was in the nightclub scene a lot

and when I was in Florida on the, uh, on the side of the road, I only lasted a few days, but I got

in at a bar as a dishwasher. So I could just, uh, potentially hustle bars nearby and, uh, try to

find an entry-level job. I used to do IT, uh, network administrator and, uh, uh, systems analyst. I can't

remember what else, but it seems like the market's dried up because everything is close to repaired

or I got shut out of it or something. Uh, I went to college, went to DeVry University for two years,

but dropped out and then, uh, studied for the CCNA, MCSE, MCP, and never passed any of the

certifications, but did the coursework. So that lasted, I got like 10 years of a career out of

all of that, but the whole thing caved in on me. So I, I've almost given up entirely on it. Um,

the, uh, the fault that happened is while I was working to slow down, I would have to just drink

at night and then I would drink at night and be able to go to sleep and then go to work and, uh,

work a full shift, but then have to drink to go to sleep. And I'm still stuck. I, I don't drink

barely at all now. So the thing, uh, kind of the whole, uh, system kind of overheats,

um, and I'm still stuck awake at night. So, uh, uh, I haven't got my sleep cycle to,

to reset itself because I always feel like I'm in the way during the day.

Um, but I don't know if I can salvage much of that IT career or just go work at a bar

because working at a bar is easy. Uh, just walk in there, clean dishes, or be a barback or

something and, uh, be good to go. Um, I also worked in retail for years, but, uh, uh, for

Circuit City and, uh, Office Depot, I can't remember where else, Target, uh, Lowe's,

and did that for years. I don't know if it's the right fit.

Um, the bar scene sure is fun, and I don't have much of a taste for alcohol.

So, uh, I was more using as, using it as a, a sedative, which walking has, has replaced. You

know, I can just walk when I'm feeling anxious and, uh, not need anything, you know, vape.

Uh, but, uh, I'll keep browsing around and looking for jobs and, uh, ways to earn a living. So

anyway, stay tuned.

Well, uh, I'm back at the park and, uh, if I had a, uh, band, this would be a great spot to, uh,

perform. I don't know what the rules are regarding an outdoor park amphitheater, but there's so many,

uh, musicians on TikTok. I was thinking, man, put something together and make some money.

Here's the amphitheater. It, uh, it's never, I've never seen anyone physically at the thing,

so it's always empty like that, and, uh, it's a pretty good spot to put something together.

Uh, there's plenty of room, so, uh, I don't know. This is in Austin. I can't remember the name of

the park. I think it's Mueller Park, but, uh, I don't know for sure. Um, uh, it would be a good

spot to, uh, try to get donations at least. Uh, I don't know. I was in band when I was a little kid,

but, uh, I played the bass clarinet, and that's all I was ever really trained on.

Uh, it, uh, it's like a gigantic clarinet, almost a, uh, it's about the size of an alto saxophone,

except black and skinny, and it makes different sounds. Uh, but the sounds I could make with it

were very similar to, like, dubstep music and stuff like that. Like, if you recorded the notes

from it, it would sound kind of dubsteppy. Um, if you put a beat behind it, it just makes really

low bass, uh, tones, and, uh, I don't have it anymore. I donated it to Goodwill,

but, uh, I, uh, I did that for a few years and then kind of fell out of it.

That would be my musical instrument if I had one. So, anyway, stay tuned.

Well, once again I'm back to trying to unravel everything my parents got into and then I

inadvertently got involved in. So everything seems to keep revolving around Las Vegas, Nevada,

which I don't want to go back to. I don't want to be there. I had enough of Las Vegas.

So my mom apparently had some interaction with or some presence with Donald Trump

that I'm trying to piece together. They must have gotten separated when they were in college. I

don't know what happened between them. She went to college at Georgetown, I think, and then dropped

out. I don't know what his backstory is. I don't want to know what his backstory is. He looks like

a total criminal at this point. I want nothing to do with him. Anything to do with him would

be association, and I don't want to be held liable for association. I don't care if he's

the president of what he is. He's a crook. So continuing further on that, if I stay out of

the way completely and the whole thing falls back into place, I think it was my dad's airplane that

pulled my mom out of whatever social circle she was in in Lake Tahoe, Nevada. And if I just like

revert the whole thing, like the airplane wasn't there, she reverts back to Lake Tahoe.

Whatever Donald Trump was doing at that time reverts back to then.

Then my whole backstory starts up where I went to middle school in Paradise Valley, Arizona,

and I was in music. And I think Katy Perry went to a middle school nearby or something. I don't

know. This falls under the same presence thing. I don't think I ever met her. I don't think I ever

had anything to do with her. But that bass clarinet, I don't know if some art engine sucked

it up or something away from me, but I stopped playing music shortly after that. After doing

really well in music class, I stopped playing music and just worked on computers after that.

And I didn't figure out until later that she went to middle school near where I did.

But I keep getting sucked into her marketing department. And I don't particularly want

anything to do with that either because everyone seems to be gay and money hungry and greedy and

violent. And that whole thing revolves around Las Vegas now. So I don't particularly want

anything to do with that, but I can't seem to get out of the web of it. And I don't have many

options to steer clear of it. It just keeps sucking me back in. So I'm trying different

avenues here in Austin, and I'm looking for different ways to change paths on the thing.

Because I'm still not making any money. My mom is paying for the hotel room

and very little food. And the only income I've seen whatsoever has come from TikTok.

And once I get in the right headspace, I'll be able to work a job because I've worked 100 jobs.

And part of the reason I can't go back to Las Vegas is I worked as a defense contractor for

the military. And it only lasted six months. I got laid off, but it still was enough to

break any connections to Las Vegas casinos. And that's what I wanted for. I was just

getting out of there. I was done with it, getting out of there. So whatever avenue I could take at

the time is what I was going for. And the defense contractor gig seemed to pull me right

out of the scene. And that was 10 years ago now. And part of the problem with the defense

contractor thing is now I have to go back through every little bit of crime that's ever occurred

with me anywhere in the vicinity of it and explain my side of the story and hope everything

clears on its own, which I'm still going through after 10 years. That's how much has been

buried in there. And my parents started the whole thing. I did my best the whole way through to

keep everything clean and law-abiding. And it was. It should show. I've never been arrested.

So I intend to keep it that way. But these haunts coming in in the middle of the night from

Las Vegas and the whole Katy Perry brand are really difficult to get through. So I'm doing

my best. I still have to take these walks and kind of cleanse myself of the whole situation.

So anyway, stay tuned.

So back at the park once again. There's a lot of birds here. I haven't been here in the morning in

a while, but there's quite a few. I went to the park in Orlando when I was stranded in Florida

and they had swans and all sorts of much prettier birds. I wish I could get some swans going here.

I don't know how difficult it is to maintain swans, but they sure worked in Florida. Here

it's just geese and ducks. I don't know what the little ones are, but I've always

liked birds for some reason. I had a bunch of them as a kid and we had everything. Peacocks,

chickens, pheasants, ducks, geese, finches, cockatiels. So quite a few birds. I like going

to the spots where the birds are, but I wish I could get more content out of this spot.

It takes me an hour to ride the bus down here and I keep thinking I'll get a great clip out

of the thing and it's just not happening. I'm like, well, all right, I'll try and get a clip

of the birds. And here we are, the very exciting birds of the lake at Mueller Park.

I keep expecting there to be something going on here,

but there never quite is. It's got that amphitheater I showed yesterday and

all sorts of restaurants and bars, but never any public events. So I'm going to keep chipping

away at it and see what new interesting content I can come up with. Stay tuned.

Still at Mueller Park and it looks like they put a lot of tennis courts here.

The last time I was here there weren't any tennis courts. I think there was a skate park

and I never walked over to it because I haven't skateboarded since I was a little kid

and it looked like it was just too much for me to be near. These tennis courts seem nice but

uh there's like 20 of them. I can't imagine. I guess this is a big city so you know you maybe

you need 20 tennis courts but uh they want five dollars to play tennis at the thing.

I used to play in high school and some college and played tennis at the parks or whatever

but I really uh I've always been more into basketball and uh changing one of these

courts into a basketball court wouldn't be that difficult and uh that would just bring in some new

new business. You could probably even charge five bucks if you keep everything really nice

and have people scheduled to come in there and everything

but having a basketball court here would be uh would be fun.

Um tennis is cool too. You know there's nothing wrong with tennis but uh having

20 empty tennis courts, I know it's early, but 20 empty tennis courts uh seems excessive.

So anyway stay tuned.

So I've been going through the U.S.-Mexico border and the Russia-Ukrainian borders and how

all these borders seem to become like polarized conflicts and like what causes the countries to

become polarized of each other and the U.S.-Mexico one is the biggest one because Mexico is like all

family and staying close to one another and I don't know just community I guess and the United

States is almost the opposite. It's all technology and transportation and moving around so distance

from the family and that has created this very polarized situation. If you could transfer some

of that like nitty-gritty, I don't know how I want to describe the Mexican side of things,

where they have the ability to stay very stationary and hold the land really well

just by physically being seated or walking around on the sidewalk or

or just turf in general whereas in the United States everyone's driving their car from one

place to another and they never really touch ground. It's always kind of levitating along

with a car and you never like just walk across nature or sit down on the actual ground.

Everyone's kind of in a pedestaled environment so if you could transfer some of that from Mexico

to the United States so have some sitting out in nature from Mexico and then some technology from

the United States down to Mexico you know you'd have a win-win situation and that would drastically

reduce the border confusion that's going on because no one really seems to want to fight

with each other that much. It's all this kind of jockeying around and disagreements that

seem to be escalating a border wall that every wall in history that has ever been made

hasn't really helped much. They always seem to be torn down and there's a huge fiasco about them.

My only real reference point is the Great Wall of China and that I think it never really held

anyone out. You know it worked for a while but then kind of just they went around it or built

around it or built the city in a different spot so the wall wasn't in the way.

But going back to Mexico you know having this tension increase along the border

is hurting a lot of trade and I used to do trips to Cancun and now I'm a little

iffy about them just because I would have to cross this tense border.

So I wish some diplomat or some peace agreement could be reached so you can reopen trade along

the border and and just reduce tensions in general. I don't know what's motivating these

migrants to want to come up here this bad. I was thinking like all the cars moving around

just creating like a vacuum that's just sucking people in and they are really good at brakes.

They can put the brakes on anything so having this many cars burning that much gas is probably

upsetting the rest of the world and that's causing them to get drawn in.

That means no one in the United States wants to hear it because they want to just keep driving

their cars around. At some point you know it's going to be more and more difficult to get gas.

The carbon emissions are going to get too much where you're just going to have to stop driving

your cars and the Mexicans are probably already to that point where they can function using much

less gas and be you know productive you know it's a productive system. So I'm going to keep

doing some research on it and figure out the best way to to learn to negotiate and reduce

conflicts between the United States and Mexico because I like Mexico. I don't want to create

side with certain people and then create an enemy that I never wanted to create. So anyway stay tuned.

So I've been looking for ways to improve my vocabulary, and the best I can come up with,

short of like reading the dictionary, would be playing Scrabble and all sorts of word building

games. I haven't found any yet that really work, but I keep searching around because I've started

writing so much that just having a hindrance of shortage of words to use is holding it back.

And ever since I was a kid, I would take those typing tests. So I got pretty fast at typing,

but now I'm just slow at figuring out what words to use and not repeating the same words over and

over again. I want to improve this writing ability as much as I can because then I can just tell the

full story and maybe make some money with it. It's a long saga. I think nothing's been written

about my legacy for three generations at least. So this would put it in the early 1900s,

since anything I know has been written down. And it has a long and sordid past.

I was digging up my Dutch ancestry, because my last name is Dutch, and a lot of symbols

came back to the Half Moon, which is an old Dutch ship, which is still afloat. It's in

the Netherlands somewhere, and then they have a replica that was made in New York,

and they shipped that back to the Netherlands. So both of them are sitting in the Netherlands.

But I think that's the basis for my whole legacy is the Netherlands. And I keep trying to dig up

the whole history of the thing, but there's a lot of missing pieces along the way. So I'm

going to work on vocabulary and just see if I can get as much writing in as possible,

see if I can get some success out of it. So anyway, stay tuned.

I finally reached the limits of this $30 cell phone's video recording ability.

I tried to record a long video of me just reviewing Doom 2. You know, I was playing a few

levels and just giving my two cents on the whole franchise as it's been going on.

And because I've been playing the game for 30 years, I had it when I was new and I bought it

again six months ago for $5. So it has been a very long-lasting video game. I want to make a

good review about it. But I got the video to go up on YouTube without just doing any editing, just

uploading the exact video as I recorded it to YouTube. But TikTok was a different story.

I tried doing it in 10-minute parts because it was like 35 minutes long.

And every single time the video would would become really choppy and completely go out

of sync with the audio when it finished uploading. And it would take forever to load the video and then

go through the upload process. And I had to do that individually for all four parts.

I tried like three times before finally giving up. This poor phone is not up for large videos.

It does these short videos like three or four minutes long pretty well. Everything's simple

and easy and I can edit and upload. And it goes through the loading process and doesn't have any

weird video problems other than the focusing which has been a little intermittent.

But when I get to big videos, it just doesn't. It won't do anything very well.

So it's a shame. I've been trying to get it to... Then I tried to just upload the direct video to

Google Drive and it wouldn't do that either. It kept failing. I tried to direct link the Google

cell phone to the Google laptop and Chrome OS doesn't appear to even recognize the phone is

there. I tried to connect with Bluetooth. It wouldn't pair. So this has been a long process.

I haven't been able to get the video to transfer over from the phone to the laptop.

It's unbelievable how problematic it has been for one video when I'm recording videos all the time.

But the second I get to a good size one, it just gives out completely. So maybe there's some way to

fix the thing. I have two of these little cell phones and one is a dedicated camera. All I use

it for is recording videos for TikTok. So I was thinking maybe there's some Linux OS I can put on

it to just get a dedicated camera functionality and maybe that would improve video quality and

be able to upload longer videos. Because it was a shame. I put a lot of work into the thing and

got it on YouTube where it has zero views because my YouTube channel does nothing.

It's been up there for a few days and still sitting firmly at zero views. But TikTok I seem

to get more interest out of if I could get these long videos to load. So anyway, stay tuned.

So, I got a few other games going on this laptop. Because it's a Chrome OS,

it has full access to the Play Store. Now, most of the games are designed for mobile,

so they're designed for a touchscreen, and I'm using a mouse and keyboard.

So, a lot of them have bugs, but it's a great concept. There's a few free games on there that

will actually play and are fun. Most of it is ad-based, so you have to watch an

ad like every 30 seconds. But I can go through the Play Store and show you

how much is on there as soon as my eyes focus from that light.

So, this is the Play Store on the thing, and it has quite a few. Once again, this laptop was $150,

and I'm just trying to get every cent out of it, or $160, I think. But I got a few to play on it.

For instance, this tennis was the latest one, and it is fun for the price tag of free.

I played tennis when I was young. I don't know. I'd have to get back in shape for the

thing. I went to the park about a month ago, and they had quite a few tennis courts there.

So, it still seems to be a game people are playing. But this poor laptop, it doesn't play

3D games very well. It really has difficulty with some of the more 3D-intensive games that

play fine on my cell phone, but just will not play on the laptop. So, I have to stick to these

really basic ones, which this is, and it does play. I'm not very good at it,

because I've only played it for five minutes. But if you give it enough time,

you could probably get something out of it. And it is free. It's just ad-based

basic tennis. And I saw Sega had their whole lineup of games on here for free, like

Sonic and Virtua Tennis. And I tried Virtua Tennis, but once again, the touchscreen controls

are... the whole thing was designed for a cell phone or tablet, and it just won't work on the

Chrome OS. The guy would keep running to the right of the screen, and you had touchscreen

controls on the screen. So, no one's really trying to develop games specifically for Chrome OS. It

seems like they're designing games for mobile, and then kind of, you know, allowing Chrome to

open the game without doing any sort of adjustment to the controls.

Which is a shame, because, you know, people... Chrome OS laptops are sold everywhere.

It's a really popular platform, but everything is steered to mobile.

I don't know. I wish they'd put a little more effort into it. I know Microsoft is the big games

brand, and the problem I was having with Microsoft is everything seems to revolve around aviation

with it, because it's just Microsoft Flight Simulator getting crammed down my throat with

Windows, and it's been that way ever since I was a little kid, when they first released Microsoft

Flight Simulator. Like, anything to do with Microsoft had to have Flight Simulator on it,

and I went through that course completely, but it was just a little bit too much for me.

So, it turns out this Chrome OS laptop has a pretty big security vulnerability.

And I'm not sure, I think it's because the Wi-Fi here is wide open,

but it puts all the computers and TVs and everything on the same

local network. So, when I bring up this cast screen, I had someone connecting. I have it

disabled now, but someone was auto-connecting to my screen and it kept going off every time

I started the laptop. So, I went in, I searched online and Reddit had a fix for it, where you

have to turn off this global media control, cast, start, stop. So, I set that to disabled.

And this is in Chrome flags, but I set that to disabled and now it doesn't seem to be

auto-casting. But why isn't there a way to just disable the cast right here? It doesn't

have an option for it. So, now I'm having trouble trusting this thing. I have to

go back through and see what other vulnerabilities it has. But that was pretty big.

What gave it away is I was just playing racing games on it. And the racing games got really

choppy all of a sudden. I was trying to figure out why is the performance stuttering so bad?

And I went through and it was casting its screen to some TV somewhere.

I don't quite know why they kept it that open by default. I guess if you're in a residential area,

if you're in a house and you have your own Wi-Fi network, then anyone in your house can connect

to the screen. But in a hotel, then anyone in the hotel can connect to your screen. So,

I would have chosen different ways to handle that. I know it's nice having features that

add to the experience of the computer, but to create that big of a security vulnerability for

with no easy way to disable other than going into what is

the Chrome registry to disable the thing seems like a pretty big issue. I'm probably going to

email Google or put a complaint in because this cast screen was too much.

I have never seen that big of a vulnerability out of a laptop out of the box.

So anyway, stay tuned.

Well, now I'm having a problem, or the same existing problem, I guess I should say.

The second I step outside, the two things that go off in my head are I have to have a cigarette

and I have to go get a Mountain Dew. The Mountain Dew is okay, but the cigarettes are the most

awful thing. Like, I don't even want them, but it's so, like, jammed in there that I have to

smoke the second I step outside. I don't know what that's about. I keep trying to, like,

find ways to jam it. Like, I got vape going pretty well and I can just sit there and puff on vape and

I don't need cigarettes, but still there's something going on where the second I step

outside I have to have a cigarette and I have to go get a Mountain Dew. So, I'm trying to

unravel what caused this level of addiction

to not have to smoke cigarettes ever again. You know, I am completely sick of them.

I'm stuck with them until I figure out a better solution, but anyway, stay tuned.

So while being in in Florida, I was there for like a year and a half, completely

stranded, completely homeless. My van got towed and I ended up getting enough

money off the corner to buy a tent. And I put that tent way out in the jungle and

I'd have to walk like two miles to the interstate and then two miles back, which

I was doing like once a week. I've probably told this story before, but that

got me a lot of experience in dealing with both, I guess, the forest jungle. It's

not quite the jungle, but there's pine trees there and there's a lot of

lush fawns and everything. So after spending a year out there, I got really

good at dealing with tropical storms. I don't think I ever really went through a

hurricane, but I did go through tropical storms in the tent and it would blow

completely flat. It wouldn't blow away. For some reason, you know, you kind

of get this idea. You think the second wind blows, the tent's gonna like fly

through the air and blow away. But if you're laying in the thing, it just kind

of folds flat. You know, it doesn't it doesn't blow up at all. If you stay close

to where the the corner where the wind's blowing, I mean, it would take a

really strong wind to move that thing at all. That was one of the few things that,

well, one of the things I learned. Also, the wildlife. Everything is territorial.

So armadillos and possums especially. This was in central Florida. Armadillos

and possums especially, like in the middle of the night, are territorial. And

you would, I would hear them like trying to make as much noise as possible to

scare me off. And it got it got old. You know, they only weigh like five pounds.

They're really small creatures, but when they're when they're acting on full

aggression, especially when you've been out there a while, so you kind of know

each other, they they really become aggressive, like running right up to you

at full speed. In the middle of the night, straight through the brush, you'll just

hear this crashing through the through the the brush. And that's an armadillo or

usually it was an armadillo. The possums would kind of stay in posture and try to

look really big, but the armadillos would just run right into the side of the tent.

In the middle of the night while I was sleeping or trying to sleep. So that was

that was a learning experience to say the least. But all that all that time out

there really adapted me to to coastal

heavy rain lifestyle. You know, I learned to I had to stay dry no matter what. So I

was dodging the rainstorms to the best of my ability and sometimes it would

rain for days and I would just sit in the tent for days just so my clothes

would stay dry because I didn't have any way to to wash them. And the only thing

that really happened, which is still ongoing, is my face started getting

infected. I never got sick once the entire time I was out there and I was

never arrested or I never got in any trouble. But my face did get infected

just from not being able to shower and having no way to clean properly. And I

think it's just from squeezing acne, you know, the whole way through my life, you

know, I was always just squeezing acne. And when you don't get to take a shower

for a while, it it swells worse than it normally would. So when all that dirt and

grime gets in your face, the the swelling gets like the size of golf

balls. So you end up having golf ball size acne. And it was bad, you know, it

that that was the only time I had the paramedics check me out once and it

would get really swollen. But the second you put those alcohol swipes on it, it

would just go right down like it was almost nothing if you barely touch it. So

it wasn't it wasn't life-threatening, but that is the only quote-unquote injury I

sustained while out there. Everything else, you know, I was pristine the entire

time. No illness, no other infections other than was on my face. So after

learning all that from living in a tent for so long, I'm looking at these other

communities and the whole reason I was out there in the first place was to

clear my name of any criminal wrongdoing. I don't know what what happened with

people in Nevada and Las Vegas specifically, but I was I was friends

with a lot of people out there. We all went out drinking and partying and I

started putting distance on them. I don't know what they got involved in. I

stayed away as far as I could. I don't know if there's any association like

what people would consider association that that isn't actually there because I

I left the city 10 years ago because it was getting too rough so I had no idea

what what they're they're doing now. But I was just sitting out there to show my

identification and show the situation I was in to try to get some support for

for everything I had been through. And that brings me to Texas now. So I'm in

Austin, Texas now and I have been eyeing Corpus Christi some. I have some resort

experience in Las Vegas and I have some golf course experience in Las Vegas as

well. And I did IT for the golf courses and security for the hotels. So this

Palmillo or Palmia, I can't remember how you pronounce it, this Palmia Beach Club

and it's just outside Corpus Christi on the on the ocean. And it is a really

interesting place. It's like a more laid-back version of Cocoa Beach, Florida

which is where I was stranded. And I'm wondering if I can just get a job there.

Like I said, I did IT for the golf courses and security for hotels and I

don't know if they want a hotel there. It would be a good spot for one to have

a nice resort hotel that people can go to and play golf on the beach and drive

their cars on the beach and and have the whole tropical experience without having

to pay so much because Florida is really expensive. And that's why I'm in Texas

now because I really like Texas. I'm from Nevada so anytime anyone brings up

where I'm from, you know Nevada and Texas, it's all ranches in Nevada and it's all

well everyone likes cowboys in Texas so it works really well together. Whereas in

Florida I had a little bit of a communication barrier because it was so

much farther away from where I was from and it was almost like I was ditching

everyone because I was so far away. Keep in mind like Florida is absolutely

gorgeous as far as the state goes but Texas is easier to communicate. I can

find more inexpensive areas. I'm from the extreme remote desert so switching to

the extreme lush tropical scenery was a big reversal and I don't know I was

thinking I could find work out there at the time and the whole thing crashed in

on me. But it was a big reversal and you know I'm half like kind of a thrill

seeker so I like doing new things, seeing new environments and seeing how well I

do when I'm so that that was the motive for Florida. But this spot in Texas, this

Corpus Christi and the Palmia Beach Resort is really tempting. Austin has

some good spots too but that beach is so pretty when I'm just watching the Don

videos. So I'm gonna see what jobs are available down there and see if I can

get my foot in the door. Anyway, stay tuned!

So I'm single, never married, no kids, and straight. And I had, you know, quite a few exes,

mostly in Las Vegas. Most of them I broke up with because they were being racist and I didn't want

to be racist. So I had to break it off with a few of them simply because they were racist.

Then I tried this stunt in Boise, Idaho, where I was still on my not-doing-anything-racist

crusade. So I was dating all the women that were part whatever. So I think I dated a Filipino,

Latin American, and a few others. Like, they were all half something. So half Latin,

half Filipino, half Black, half Native American. And it was fun, but I couldn't get a relationship

to stick at all. It just wouldn't work. So I finally gave up at it. I'm Dutch and with a

little sliver of Middle Eastern. I don't even know specifically where the Middle Eastern sliver is,

but I'm thinking Israel, maybe. I wish I had more information on it. I don't. You know,

I tried to dig up my ancestry and just couldn't find it. So I gave up. It's Middle East something.

But I've been single for a little bit. You know, I had to stop everything I was doing

because I was getting too successful and that was getting me in trouble. You know,

people just get mad about it when you get too many girls. So I had to stop and go through

my family's legacy and figure out what was crime and what wasn't and resolve any crime that was

committed. The only thing I ever really found, which was really loose, I might add, was my dad

had a foreign bank account that he never paid taxes on, but the money was never in the United

States to begin with. So the second I hauled it to the United States, I paid all the taxes on it and

that cleared any tax evasion charges. I don't know if that's technically a crime even because

the money was never in the United States. It wasn't earned in the United States. It was

earned overseas and then held in a British bank account. And then when he passed away,

I closed the bank account, paid the taxes, paid the income taxes, and then received the money.

This was all thanks to the help of Beverly Hills, California, because I was completely stuck with

the thing. I couldn't get the money through. And so I half squatted in Beverly Hills and

kind of hidden the brush and then went to the library every day and never got in any

trouble there either. But I was there for like a year trying to get this thing dug up

because there's even more involvement in Beverly Hills. My grandfather on my mother's side

was CEO of a tool company called Landis Tool Company. And the whole thing closed down. She

was the only daughter. She was adopted and she was the only daughter of him and he was CEO for like

30 years. This was a good-sized company. And the company that bought Landis Tool Company was this

one called Litton Industries, which is based in Beverly Hills, California. And Litton

owns Landis Tools, but then Northrop Grumman bought out Litton. So Northrop Grumman owns

Litton Industries. And now everything's turned into this giant defense contractor conglomerate.

And it sure would be nice to get both Litton Industries and Landis Tool Company

fried away from Northrop Grumman. But this goes in tune with my government surveillance.

The government has to take over everything. So these two very independent companies ended up

getting bought out by a very large defense contractor. And I think the remains of Landis Tool

Company is operating out of Maryland somewhere. And I looked it up at one point. I don't know if

my grandfather's legacy really has anything to do with it at this point. It's just a name.

My middle name was his last name. And that would show at Litton Industries in Beverly Hills

that my grandfather was CEO of one of their acquisitions. Which gives my name some

punch in Beverly Hills, which, you know, that's a fun spot. I really like Beverly Hills. That's one

of my favorite spots in the country. It always seems like it's a party there. You got Hollywood

right next door. They have all those multi-million dollar mansions. So I like the spot.

I don't know what connections I could come up with in Litton Industries if I can use any of

my middle name from my grandfather to get into Litton Industries and then be able to salvage

any of his career out of the thing. But it would be fun to try. And Beverly Hills is the only place

I've had any success getting this whole legacy cleaned of any criminal wrongdoing. Which doesn't

seem to be much. It seems like a lot of hearsay and conjecture without actually any crime committed.

So once again I'm back to eyeing Beverly Hills, California. I left on a Fat Moto,

which is the last time I was there. I left on a Fat Moto, which is a 79cc

motorized bicycle. I ended up riding it the whole way across California

from Coachella to Blythe, which was the hardest part of the whole trip.

It was like 90 miles of dirt trail and then I barely made it in Arizona and the thing fell

apart on me. The whole reason I left Beverly Hills in the first place is I barely got like

$40,000 in and then it wasn't enough money to completely get my foot in the door in Beverly

Hills and I had to find a cheaper zip code to be in to continue cleaning everything up. So I ended

up going to Lake Havasu City and that's where I bought that van and I lived in the van for a year

or year and a half and then the van got towed and I got stranded again in Florida and that's

the story I was telling before. But it sure would be nice if whatever magic spell Beverly Hills has

could dig up the last of this legacy. I was oblivious to it. I was so young and when my

grandfather was working for Landis Tools, so I don't know any of the specifics, he moved to Arizona

and then went to a retirement home and I went to boarding school in Paradise Valley, Arizona.

But they still, I think Lytton Industries really remembers Landis Tools

and it would be nice to get something going again. So anyway, stay tuned.

Not much of an update, but I'm back down by the pond. This is the best walking spot. It's

full of trash. So, you know, I saw all sorts of treasures. They're not that great. I mean,

there's a shopping cart, so that's sort of interesting, but I'm having trouble getting

footage. Someone appears to attempt to have attempted fishing here. There's a fishing lure,

but I haven't seen any fish. I saw turtles over there, but every time I tried to go over there,

they hopped in the water. So, my wildlife is sparse, but I'm trying to get more footage and

more interesting clips. The only things I've seen around here are possums and raccoons,

and every time I try to take the camera out to record them, they run off, or they're just too

quick for me to catch up with, but I have a lot of experience with wildlife.

I've lived in Alaska multiple times, and the second to last time I lived up there,

an Alaska brown bear almost walked right up to me, and it was the size of a car.

Also, the moose up there were huge. They would lick the salt off the trailer,

get way too close, and they were way too life-threatening. So, the biggest problem I had

with Alaska is the wildlife is just so dangerous that I had to give up on it. Then, when I was in

Florida, all the wildlife there that I mentioned before, but I've seen all sorts of stuff. I

camped in Montana for a while, and I was right at the corner of the Grizzly Bear Wildlife Refuge,

whatever it's called. I never actually saw a grizzly bear. I didn't even know I was that

close to it, but I saw stuff like owls and deer and elk. When I lived in Astoria, Oregon,

I'd go down to the beach, and there would be a huge herd of elk. All of this, I wish I recorded

at the time, but I just wasn't filming anything at that time, so I missed all this great footage.

I sure could be using it now. I don't know what other stuff I've seen. A lot of ocean,

you know, like dolphins in the ocean and all those pelicans and birds along the coast, but

nothing here in Austin, Texas. So, anyway, stay tuned.

So I've been uploading my videos every time with first try first take so just whatever I'm thinking

I just ramble into the camera and it's been it's been working it got some ratings doing it that way

now I'm having trouble doing the transition to switching to like choreographing videos before

I upload them. Like I'll have everything pre-plotted and like try to try to say it as as I'm

thinking it but uh it kind of it seems to fumble whereas I'll do completely different videos

um when I just do whatever stream of consciousness you know just talking into the camera which is

what started this whole thing in the first place is um you know whatever whatever I was thinking

just tell it to the camera and see see who's listening um but uh I uh I'm gonna have to

start switching to choreographed clips I think or at least learn how uh I have no film production

experience whatsoever um the only experience I really have is what's on this thing uh so I don't

know like all the different tricks to get ratings and stuff like that um which would be nice because

this channel's going pretty well uh so uh you know adding adding a little professionalism to it

wouldn't hurt but uh this system I've been using has been so uh so easy and uh and uh you know

successful for the most part just whatever I'm thinking telling it to the camera and uploading it

and uh seeing what happens so anyway stay tuned

So I dug up my old Super Impreza forums account on Nazioc, which is this old forum.

I started this thing in 2001, and it was all because I had Impreza RS,

and I guess it won't show my member number here, but it's like 11,000. And the biggest competition

with this thing is who can have the lowest member number. So I'm at 12,687. Most of them are at

300 and something, except, all right, there's 300,000. So there have been a lot of new members

since I created this account. And the reason I created it is in 2001, I had a 2.5 RS,

and it had a curb weight of 2,800 pounds, but it was a non-turbo. And the cars in Europe and Japan,

they had the WRX, and it weighed 2,800 pounds and had a turbo, which me at 18,

19 years old was the most important thing, that the car had a turbo on it. So then in 2002,

they released the WRX, and it had the turbo, but it suddenly gained 600 pounds and weighed 3,300

pounds instead of the 2,800, very light little car. So I wish they would... The United States

has never seen a turbo Impreza at 2,800 pounds. And I don't quite know why, because it worked

everywhere else. It must've been some safety standard or something, but that sure would have

been a fun car to have, four-wheel drive, very lightweight, and enough power to get around.

So I'm on the forums now, wishing they would go back and try and release a much lighter

Impreza, and we'll see how it goes. Anyway, stay tuned.

I, uh, when I was like 21, I think online dating became a thing and that would have been 20 years

ago now. Um, I picked up like one native American girl and like one other girl, uh, from online

dating in Arizona. When I moved to Vegas though, uh, that's when the thing kind of opened up. Um,

I, I was in a committed relationship for like four years and it turned out she cheated on me,

so I broke up with her and then I just gave up on the thing and, uh, uh, started an online dating

account. And the perfect scheme in that town is to just, uh, talk to a girl and then take her to a

casino. And that would like clear out any ex-boyfriends or, or, uh, siblings or whatever.

And you could just get with the girl pretty easily. That proved to be too successful. Um,

that was one of the reasons I had to leave Las Vegas, uh, was because it was, it was just alcohol

and picking up girls on online dating. And it, it, uh, it would have caused a downward spiral

had I let it continue. Um, I did end up bailing, uh, before it like caught up to me, but, uh, uh,

it was, uh, it was really successful. And now looking at, at modern times with TikTok and the

new online interaction, um, it doesn't, you know, everything is, uh, influenced, you know, you're

influencing each other without directly communicating. Whereas before it was all direct

communication. Um, everything was direct communication. So, uh, I don't know which is better. Uh,

the old version, you know, old online dating sure did have a steep slope to fall down. You know,

if you made one slip up with that thing, uh, it got dangerous quickly. This, um, social influencer,

you know, you can kind of, uh, uh, get to know the circle of friends you're getting involved with

before, uh, you know, picking someone up. Uh, so, uh, that's a little safer. Um, I don't know. It

sure was a lot of fun with that old online dating system. Um, I've, uh, I've given up on it. I like

telling my story more now these days. Um, but, uh, it was, it was an absolute riot in Las Vegas

when I got it to work. Uh, I got about a good three years out of it where it would just, you know,

I could get a hotel room or, uh, have women show up at my front door. It was, uh, it was too much

for the normal world, but, uh, was a lot of fun for Las Vegas in your late twenties for a couple

of years. And then knowing when to stop, which was the most important part. So, uh, anyway, stay tuned.

So, while I've been getting my face to clear and getting through all my insomnia and other issues,

I've been watching movies. And, you know, a few good ones here and there.

The latest one I saw was Chicago, which was free on YouTube movies.

And I was born and raised in Nevada, very close to all the casinos. And as a kid, you know,

I'd watch movies like Who Framed Roger Rabbit and Dick Tracy. Those were the movies that were out

there. And Chicago is like a big souped up version of all of that. All those nightclubs and sort of,

I never actually directly saw any crime. So I never was involved. I never had to confess or

rat or snitch anyone out. But probably given the chance, I just would have snitched through the

whole thing. After watching Chicago, it's like they're having the same problem there that we

were having in Nevada with nightclub singers and all the crime associated with nightclub singers.

You have a bunch of guys who are questionable and you put a pretty girl on stage and everything

goes downhill. So that movie captured that really well. And the most frustrating part is,

you know, a lot of times they get off scot-free because there's just not enough police presence

available to resolve any crime. Which is why I left, or a major part of why I left

Nevada entirely, is because I like the police. You know, I want the police to be around.

It's more comfortable with the police than without. So I'm still trying to get my foot in

the door in nicer areas and getting everything cleaned up that my parents got into. So anyway,

stay tuned!

So, once again, woke up in the middle of the night. Can't sleep. Same old

issues. So I'm out walking around. It's raining a little bit, but I watched a few YouTube music

videos. I saw Coachella was going on and watched like five minutes of the live feed of the thing,

and the only thing I saw in there was Grimes. Like right when I clicked on it, Grimes'

set was on, and she looked like she was having some trouble. She played like three songs,

and then the whole thing shut off. They were having some technical difficulty,

and I turned it off after that. But that got me thinking, you know, I never learned how to dance

at all, and I've never been very good at it, but I've always been near music. Like I've

been to a million concerts and all sorts of music festivals. EDC, Burning Man,

a million different rock concerts, all sorts of DJ sets all over the place. This was during my

20s, so there was a lot of music and everything. And I'm wondering now, like, you know, I never

learned how to dance through all of that, and I don't even know what I'd be good at.

But it's a shame I never developed that skill. I think I'm just like naturally kind of rigid.

So anyway, stay tuned.

So, I'm back at this pond and I was watching clips of old movies that I used to like.

Back when I was in IT, this would have been 2001 I think, I can't remember when it came out,

but it was a movie called Swordfish and it always made an impression on me because

you know, computers were the new exciting thing and it was a very interesting movie

because it involved what was the Department of Defense at those times, now I think it's called

the Cyber Security Division or something, so I think the Department of Defense is a different

department. But anyway, continuing further on that, when I was in Vegas, my get out of jail

free card that I ended up using was, I was working for golf courses in Vegas and you know, how I was

pulling it off was, I was doing IT during the day and then drinking to slow myself down at night.

And the problem with that strategy is you can only maintain the work if you have the breaks at night

to use and I couldn't, you know, you can't just drink every night to go to sleep and be any sort

of a healthy person. So, I had to give up on the entire design and when I stopped drinking, you

know, I couldn't do the work because there would be too much pressure to work the same job.

So, going back, you know, I had quit doing the IT business and just switched over to doing security

and then I switched over from doing security to working for, doing IT for the Department of

Defense. I was just a contractor, I wasn't actually an employee, but did that for like

six months and then was laid off and went through this whole spiel of all the crime my parents

committed that most of it, you know, it'd be incredibly hard to prosecute even them

for any sort of crime and I've done everything in my power to get a paper trail on any money that

was earned and pay any back taxes and resolve any questions that may arise, which is part of the

reason for this channel in the first place is just telling my side of the story of everything I

remember. So, anyway, I think my original link to the Department of Defense was that movie Swordfish

because there were only like five or six good, good like IT hacker movies in the 90s and 2000s.

The only three I can remember right now are Hackers, Swordfish, and Antitrust.

So, I'm sure there were others, I just don't remember them specifically, but I wish I could

get back in the pacing of that IT, but the problem is I base the thing on so much alcohol

that in order to not get too frustrated with the system, with the systems I was trying to fix or

repair, I would need so much alcohol to maintain that's not even worth working the job in the first

place. I might as well just be poor and not drinking than rich and drinking. So, I'm still

trying to see if I can find a way to scavenge as much of that as possible or salvage as much

of that as possible, but it hasn't happened yet. You know, I'm still like, I slow simple jobs where

I don't need alcohol to slow down, or what am I? Like, you know, dishwasher, you know, I could be

a dishwasher for a restaurant and climb up that way. I could be a dishwasher bar back bartender

for a golf course and climb up that way, but I don't really know what the best direction to head

in is right now. My, I keep thinking my, you know, a couple days my face will be clear, a couple more

days my face will be clear. It hasn't happened yet. So, I don't know which path to take.

I'm open to ideas. Because I spent so much time in Las Vegas at the clubs and

and party scene, you know, my sleep cycle is still atrocious, would be the word, because

some nights I'll go to sleep at 10 and wake up at like 2 and then sleep midday and then other

nights I'll be up from, I'll be up till 4 a.m. and sleep till noon. It's just completely all over

the place. I haven't gotten a thing to reschedule and it's taking forever. You know, it didn't help

when I was, when I was without a house because it was really difficult to sleep at night.

I would end up just walking endlessly and I think part of that is the not drinking

would just make me, you know, without any sort of sedative you get really wired just naturally.

So, without any alcohol whatsoever, you know, I wasn't wasn't sedating myself anymore and I

just got really energetic without any substances. So, I'm eyeing around Austin, you know, the

track club car scene would be fun to get into. I don't know what best direction to get my foot

in the door is. I don't have much restaurant experience but the easy, you know, the simple way

to just socialize and meet people and find the best direction is just go work for a restaurant

at the bottom end job and then start making friends and meeting people and working your

way up from there. So, that's the easy way. This poor IT career, you know, I went to college for

five years. I didn't graduate from anything. I had a weird test-taking problem where

like I would pass the curriculum really easily but I couldn't pass the certification exam for

anything and so dropped out of DeVry, took the CCNA courses but couldn't pass the exam,

took the MCSE courses but couldn't pass the exam. So, I'm still, you know, if I can salvage

that thing for some money, I will. Otherwise, I don't know. Because I'm watching technology get

simpler and simpler and less need to repair. I mean, you can set up a Linux box these days.

They'll last indefinitely. It just needs to go on the internet, check email, check the news,

and watch YouTube. So, it doesn't need a repairman ever. So, like trying to restart that whole

thing, a lot of what I'm seeing about the current IT industry is that guys are like purposely

breaking things to stay in business, you know. It's purposely intermittent just so they can keep

getting calls and keep getting paychecks, which I don't want anything to do with because that's

just another scam to me. I might as well just go work for a restaurant and feel good about myself.

So, I may just avoid it entirely. This content creation is going pretty well.

If I can keep it going and get better programming, you know, better content,

more interesting footage, more than my current stories, I'll go that route. But, you know,

it would work if I went and worked for a restaurant. It would work in addition to this content creator.

You know, I could be making content while working for a restaurant. So, I don't know

how many hours I'm putting into these clips, but there's a little bit of thinking

about it beforehand before uploading the clip. So, that's time consuming. I don't know if that would

cost the quality or how much devotion I put into the thing if I'm working a full-time job on top of it.

So, anyway, stay tuned.

So, I'm sitting outside watching the line of stationary cars.

It's morning rush hour and the parking lot is sitting right in front.

So, it's a pretty good TV show.

I don't know if it's profitable to have traffic congestion this early in the morning.

I ran out of money. I think someone's sitting over at the cardboard spot.

I'm not completely out of money. I shouldn't say that.

I think I have like $80 left, but I've been running on savings for so long that I got used to it.

Because I had one video that did really well on here and got like six months out of the thing.

Where I didn't have to beg on the side of the road for money.

But that six months is coming to an end.

So, I have to like prepare.

And the second I step outside, I still have to smoke a cigarette.

So, nothing has changed there.

I had it mostly jammed up with the vape.

But that appears to have fallen apart and I'm just back to smoking cigarettes.

I have been looking for ways to turn a profit.

Because my face won't clear, it keeps just going and going and going.

And the second I stop scratching it, I have large swells.

So, I have to scratch it to get the swelling out.

And it's what's really the inhibiting factor in this whole thing.

I'm getting swept up in like trying to find ways to tell my story in a profitable way.

Because it's a good size one.

I tried writing 61 pages in Google documents.

And I would need more writing lessons to make it sellable.

Or have someone proofread the thing.

And I've also been telling my story on here.

I was thinking, you know, as I walked out the door today.

I used to have an old DRZ400 Black Widow.

Which was a street legal dual sport enduro.

And I was thinking about that type of motorcycle.

What you get yourself into with it.

Because it is a hooligan motorcycle.

And while I'm sitting on the side of the road, you know, it's hooligan.

Everything is hooligan from this spot.

And all that motorcycle would do is like you'd want to ride it under the culvert pipes.

Like you could ride it through culvert pipes.

This was in Las Vegas.

And I don't think, I never went by any no trespassing signs or keep out signs or anything.

So I don't think it would have been in violation.

But still, I find the temptation of that thing starting up now.

Because I'll look at a culvert pipe and wonder, hey I wonder what's going on in there.

In Las Vegas there's people living down underneath.

When I was without a house, I was one of the tents.

So I just live in a tent.

And this was in Florida in the jungle.

And I also was without a house in Southern California.

And I would sleep under the overpasses and I don't know, just at strip malls.

Sometimes out in the desert.

But it was a tough climb out of Los Angeles.

I don't particularly want to go back there for anything.

It wasn't very good.

Florida was better.

When I was in Los Angeles, I didn't know how to beg with cardboard.

So I was just digging out trash cans for food.

And this took, I was probably there a year and a half.

I would sit in front of grocery stores and sometimes people would donate.

That's as far as I got.

Once I got to Florida, I got the full cardboard operation going.

And it worked pretty reliably.

I was doing that up until I figured out how to point a camera at myself and start uploading videos.

Which has brought me to the position I'm in now.

Also, when I was in Southern California, speaking of the DRZ400,

I got a little money and I bought a little Fat Moto 79cc motorized bicycle.

And the problem with that thing was, because it was so small,

because it was a 79cc, you were supposed to have a plate on it.

And the limit is 49cc.

Nowhere in the brochure or anything does it say that.

So you would think, oh I can ride this thing on the shoulder and be fine.

But that wasn't the case.

So I ended up selling that bike for silver.

I got silver coins out of it and then sold those to a coin shop.

And bought gas with the money.

It's kind of like, if I have a car, all I do is buy gas and go around in circles.

And if I have any money, all I do is buy cigarettes and smoke them all.

Once I get through whatever that is, I'll be able to make a little progress.

But this traffic is still stopped here.

Everyone, it's really interesting from this perspective, watching the traffic.

Because you just see a bunch of cars herd by.

So like, this is especially when you don't know what day or time or anything it is.

It's like just a herd of vehicles all start up at once.

Herd one direction, and then some time later everything just herds the other direction.

And you're operating under a completely different perspective.

So it's almost comical.

It's like the Native Americans, I was thinking about the Native Americans with it.

And they would think it's the buffalo migrating back and forth.

But I don't know, there's probably this whole animal lecture about it.

About the animal of traffic and what motivates the whole thing to migrate back and forth.

But being sitting on the side of the road is such a unique perspective for it.

I like thinking about it.

Anyway, stay tuned.

So having such a strange life existence, you know, being without food for extended periods,

having to scavenge for whatever, has done things to my appetite that I don't know how to fix yet.

So the second I get food, you know, if I get any good food, I just gorge through it all in a day,

which is really a problem because, I don't know, if I had enough food, I would just gorge until,

you know, I weighed 400 pounds. I don't know how to turn that appetite off, you know. I smoke

cigarettes, and cigarettes kind of limit the thing, but it is really, it is big. I hadn't

even thought about it until I got some good food in the other day and just ate it all in a day,

that it really might be an issue. If I have a stocked fridge, you know, I'll be at 400 pounds

in a year at this rate. So sitting outside, you know, cigarettes are an appetite suppressant,

but I can't just chain smoke cigarettes to turn it off, you know. There has to be a healthier

option to this appetite, and I do get some exercise just from walking around, but

I hadn't even considered, you know, after being without food for so long, or not having

steady supply of food, what happens the second I have a stocked fridge, you know.

I just gorge on the whole thing until there's no food, you know, 400 pounds.

So I don't know how difficult it's going to be to fix that. I'm in good shape now,

but it won't last if I have a fully stocked fridge. So anyway, stay tuned.

So, I think I've been watching music videos for too long.

You know, when I was a little kid,

when we moved to Arizona, we first got cable.

And I had never seen cable before.

And the first thing that came on there was MTV.

And this was back when MTV played videos or even existed.

I don't even know if it's relevant anymore.

Because I haven't turned on the TV.

But it was a big deal.

Like, I could sit there and turn on music videos on MTV

and then turn on the computer and play video games.

And just watch music videos and play video games

during all my leisure hours.

And this went on for years.

That kind of adapted.

I think there was an MP3 phase that I went through.

And then that whole thing switched over to YouTube.

Because the whole transition I made

was I switched from...

I was playing orchestra instruments, a bass clarinet,

and switched that over to computers.

Because, you know, music on the computer is really entertaining.

It is just an entertaining place for music to be.

So I was completely trained in music.

And then switched directly to computers

to kind of put music on the computer.

And just so you have something to do with the thing,

you know, you turn it on and it's just a box.

So there's got to be something on the screen to be entertaining.

And so I think that was my motive as a kid.

Was to use the computer to make sounds

instead of using a bass clarinet to make sounds.

And it worked for the longest time.

But now, I think I just need to quit on the music videos.

Because I have all sorts of memories of these music videos going off.

That I don't need.

Don't particularly want.

It's all the little pop singers too.

That being a guy, you know,

I like watching the girl music videos instead of the guy music videos.

So I watch all the girl ones.

But then I have all these little memories of the things going off in them.

And they all look pretty close to strippers.

I don't mean to offend anyone.

But I don't know how far off they are or what their backgrounds are.

But it always seems more tasteful.

Like if you think, just, you know,

wanting to look at pretty girls, where do you go?

You have like three different options.

And I always thought the cleanest one was the music video crowd.

Because you get to see a pretty girl and there's a song.

And it has that whole party going for it.

Whereas the other stuff, like the actual strip club for instance,

that thing is always too much.

You know, when I was in my 20s in Vegas,

we would go out and go to the strip clubs.

I probably went to all of them with a group of friends quite a few times.

But I got sick of them.

It was too much.

You know, just not any fun.

I wasn't having any fun with those things.

So I always wanted money.

It was a huge hustle.

So, you know, to get that all out of my system,

I would just watch music videos instead

and see the pretty girl in the music video

instead of seeing the pretty girl in the stripper pool.

Which seemed to work, but now I'm tired of the music videos.

And all they do is kind of link you up with the club scene.

And the clubs are way, way better.

But I'm getting too old for that now.

So I don't know what to do to occupy my time.

You know, part of it is just mindless entertainment.

So just looking for entertainment of any kind.

And there's only three things on the computer.

Music, video games, and writing and news.

So if that's the only thing sitting in front of you,

then that's what you got.

My earliest device that I remember,

which I'm still using to this day,

is when I was a really little kid,

my parents gave me a deck of playing cards,

and I learned how to play solitaire with it.

So I'd play solitaire endlessly.

And I still do.

Like, I can still just play five games of solitaire in a row,

just trying to get everything, you know,

all the math and all the weird combinations of solitaire

to fall into place just right so you win the game.

And I still like playing solitaire.

And because it's real solitaire,

like you're really playing with a deck of cards,

not the computer one where, you know,

everything's kind of half done for you,

it's a lot more fun to me.

I don't know.

I'm wondering, because Microsoft is so based on that solitaire,

computer solitaire game,

like their entire brand is based on that free solitaire

that comes with Windows.

I don't know.

I've always kind of locked in with the real playing cards one.

I don't know if that keeps me detached from the rest of the Microsoft world,

but I had to finally give up on Microsoft Windows entirely

just because I got tired of the spyware

and all the weird things that cost money.

You know, everything costs money.

Office went from being, you know,

you had to spend like $60 to go to office.

There was another one with Windows 3.1.

I can't remember what it was called.

But it was really cheap, and you had a word processor with it.

And now with Microsoft, you know,

you need that 365, which has a monthly charge,

and really doesn't make a lot of sense for what you're getting.

Whereas Google Chrome OS, you know,

you get Google Docs for free.

It's hype all day in Google Docs.

I've pretty much given up on Microsoft entirely.

But back to that solitaire thing,

I don't know if the rest of the population plays,

you know, you get used to playing solitaire on the computer,

and I'm playing solitaire with real cards.

Is that somehow distancing me from the rest of people?

Just because I'm still using real playing cards.

And that thing's based on an old Western casino system

I got out of Winnemucca that, you know,

you play solitaire, you think about a card dealer,

and it just kind of chugs through whatever.

And I don't know what the card dealer side is.

The way I got that thing originally is my mom was a card dealer

for a few casinos in Lake Tahoe, Reno, Tonopah, Winnemucca.

And so I could sit there and play solitaire as a kid,

and she'd go deal cards, and it would just work.

I could be entertained with solitaire pretty easily.

So if you switch that over to the computer one, it doesn't work,

because what is she doing?

What's the girl or woman you're thinking about doing

while you're playing the games?

And I know that Microsoft spins off in a weird direction.

Anyway, I'm just trying to ramble out whatever I'm thinking about,

trying to keep some sort of new, interesting stories going into this thing.

So anyway, stay tuned.

So, uh, now walking in the rain. Decided to make a clip. I'm getting too swept up in

pop singers again. This time it's Taylor Swift. She just made that new video,

uh, Fortnite. And it reminds me of things in Austin, like, uh, typewriters, uh, typewriter poetry in

in front of the Driscoll. Uh, there's guys out there that will type out poems for people.

And, uh, seen him a few times in front of the Driscoll, which is this old, uh, hotel in Austin.

And, uh, I don't know. There's some similarities there. Uh, I'm trying to stay out of it. It looks

like a lot of, uh, bad, uh, problems in there, in the pop singer world. Um, there's got to be some

kind of con going on with them making all that money. Uh, but I have no money, so I'm just

exploring every, every avenue to earn a living. And, uh, because I have so much history in,

in, uh, clubs and music, all that, uh, it could be money. But, man, they seem to get beat up in the,

on the other side of the screen. Like, I'm almost safer sitting out here

than being on the other side of that thing. I don't know what they're doing. Um,

there's a lot of hesitation involved with even, like, trying to open the door on any one of them.

Uh, but, man, are they raking in cash. I was looking at the view count she was getting,

and it was at 20 million views in a day. So, one day she got 20 million. That's a,

that's a really successful video. Her and, uh, and my mom are very similar. Uh,

they're both from Pennsylvania, and they both act like that. Uh, I don't know, uh, I can see

from her mannerisms in the video that it's, like, a lot of similarities. Um,

I don't want to use the phrase, uh, hooker, but I'm pretty sure both of them were hookers at one

point. Uh, I, uh, I can see them working the brothel or in front of the truck stop,

and, uh, uh, just exploiting and conning and ripping off everyone they come across.

So, I had this big, huge blowout with my mom where, uh, we were, we worked on a ranch together,

and I was promised some money out of the thing, and then she tried to sell it, and the rest of

the town was wondering if I owned the place, what was my share of the house. Um, while I was out

there, she showed up and said she had a gun and never wanted to see me again. I had all my

belongings sitting out there, and so, uh, I had, I lost everything at that point. I just had to run

for my life. Um, now, Taylor seems to be very similar to her, so I can imagine any interaction

with Taylor would probably turn out the same, whereas, you know, suddenly she shows up with

the gun and says she never wants to see me again, and everything I own is, suddenly becomes hers.

So, uh, and with her making all that money, uh, she's got to be doing something like that to, to

get away with it. So, uh, uh, I'm trying to avoid it, but, man,

having no cash whatsoever is getting old. Uh, anyway, stay tuned.

So, uh, I'm walking around. You know, I had two Mountain Dews, I think, from Taco Bell today, so

it's not the worst addiction you can have, but it's an addiction. You know, I just like Mountain Dew.

Everyone has their thing, you know, what can you do? It was the, the awesome Baja Blast ones,

so they, uh, they really, I think that is the best alternate flavor to Mountain Dew,

is Baja Blast. But, uh, uh, I was going through everywhere I've been and all the, uh, all the

things I've done. In Alaska, the sole reason I was up there in the first place was my dad was, uh,

uh, a bush pilot, and he flew a plane up there, and then he would fly me up there in the little

bush, and it was dangerous as all, as can be. And so, uh, I went up when I was older, and now I've,

I've just about completely given up on it. Like, it is so far away, and it feels like I'm ditching

everyone when I go up there. Uh, so, hang on, it feels like I'm ditching everyone when I go up there.

So, uh, uh, I'm just planning on staying out of it. I love the beach like you wouldn't believe. I love

the scuba dive and all the ocean life. Um, it's better than bears and moose and grizzlies, so

I like all the ocean, uh, uh, events and, uh, boats and the whole, the whole deal. Um, so I'd love to stay

where it's warm and tropic, um, which Texas is really good at because I fit in well, and, uh,

and it's got the big old coast on the south. Um, but all three, you know. I don't want to

particularly go back to Los Angeles, but it does have the beach right there, and then, uh, Texas

and Florida. Central Florida has a really nice beach too. So, uh, uh, you know, for scuba diving,

it's great. Uh, I'm, uh, trying to cross the road. There's a car accident up here,

and I was going to walk up to the thing,

seeing if I could make it to it. Oh, they just pulled away right when I get there.

There goes the car. There's just a bunch of blinking lights, but, uh, uh, it, it seemed like something

eventful. I, uh, I am bored. I'm gonna be awake all night, and, uh, you know, just kind of

gravitating to anything blinking right now, and those lights were blinking, so I came over here.

I don't know. It looked like it was just a fender bender. Uh, anyway, going back to, uh,

I think I've traveled too much. Um, I, uh, I'm trying to be more stationary,

so, uh, like, I've been, I've been everywhere. You know, I'm from Winnemucca, and Johnny Cash

wrote a song called I've Been Everywhere, and, uh, uh, the, the intro lyrics to that song are

something about a dirt road in Winnemucca, and, uh, I have lived the existence of that song.

It, uh, it really is that, you know, it, uh, I've traveled all over the country,

all over the continent, um, and, uh, I think I'm done with Alaska. I don't know about Canada.

I've been to Canada a few times, too. Uh, going up north, it's not very good. You know, it's so

cold you get stuck in a cabin. Um, uh, further south, you know, Jackson Hole, I've been to Aspen

once. Uh, Jackson Hole was nice. I don't have enough money for Aspen, so it's, it's kind of

out. Uh, uh, let's see, where else? What other ski resorts? Lake Tahoe. My parents are from Lake

Tahoe, but, uh, I sure do like warm weather. I'll be happy if I can stay in the warm weather

as long as possible. Anyway, stay tuned.

So I've been going back through like everything I've been through and wandering around Los Angeles

for a year and a half and the one thing that occurred, you know, I'm just looking for basic

stories to tell. I was, I crash landed at LAX and I was there for a month or two. I tried to get

into the social welfare homeless thing and it didn't work. So I applied and made an appointment

and waited, did that like three or four times and just gave up. So finally wandered away from

from LAX after a month or two and walked about a mile away and saw someone threw out a perfectly

good, well it wasn't perfectly good, it was in in rough shape, but a mongoose mountain bike.

So I asked the guy who's at the house if he was throwing it away. He said yeah and I could

I could have it if I wanted. So I got my free mountain bike. The gears didn't work, the tires

were flat. I don't know what else was wrong with it. It had a few issues but I took it to one of

those canals and put it back together and got it rideable. So it was rideable in one gear and went

all over Los Angeles on that thing. All the way down to Newport Beach up to Santa Monica, you know,

on the bicycle trails and I would just like collapse over when I got tired and then start

back up again the next day and just ride around. I was still completely motivated by picking up

leftover cigarettes, which I don't know how bad that is now. I've had, because I got money from

one of these TikTok videos, I've had enough cigarettes for like six months and I've been

trying to throttle the thing back like more and more so I don't want cigarettes. But it just keeps

going off, same as always. So I don't know if that's gonna, if I go bankrupt or when I go

bankrupt again, if that's gonna kick over where I like obsessively have to go find cigarettes.

Anyway, that's what was motivating me all over Los Angeles. So I was riding that mountain bike

everywhere and I think I got to Riverside, I think it was Riverside, the name is really sticking

in my head. But I, the bike got a flat tire again and it had like four flat tires by that point.

I had repaired it with patch kits and

got it fixed a few times but it kept going flat. So I finally got frustrated with it

and just parked it on the side of the road and walked away. And like 12 or 14 hours later I

walked back to see if the bike was still there and it was gone. I was so upset with it that

I didn't care if someone took it or if they accepted my donation

because it had gotten really frustrating having to fix the tire over and over again.

I don't know if that tripped some alarm, me leaving a mountain bike on the side of the road.

I ended up walking, so I gave up on that bike at Riverside and then I ended up walking

to, oh I can't remember the name of that, Morongo, that casino that's out there. And I stayed at the

outlet stores for a couple months and then gave up on there and

walked all the way to Palm Springs which was another like 30 miles across the desert.

That was the hardest walk. Made it across and

stayed out there, made it out to Palm Desert. I think I walked, this was all on camera,

I think I walked, this was all on foot, walked all the way to the border of Coachella

and then started walking back. I was tempted by the Salton Sea but strangely, you know,

I never once got arrested during this whole ordeal. Never got in trouble, never got arrested,

was just kind of going everywhere trying to get out of the scramble I was in.

And it had me in a full-blown panic the entire time. So I went, I was stuck in a panic for years

and I ended up walking back. I was in Palm Desert for quite a while

and then just sitting out by the mall and then ended up walking back to Palm Springs, got a ride

and got driven to Burbank and then had to ditch that guy. He was too much and

walked over to Beverly Hills. I think I was in Beverly Hills for a while

before finally getting a library card and then able to talk to my mom's attorney to get inheritance

through in Beverly Hills. And then I got a debit card from Bank of America and put the money I

inherited in a Bank of America account and then bought another bicycle, a motorized bicycle,

and rode it the entire way across Southern California to Blythe and then up to Lake Havasu.

The thing gave out on me halfway at Lake Havasu. So I then with the rest of my money bought a van,

put a bike, put the bike in the back of the van and tried to repair it. I spent six months trying

to repair it, finally gave up and sold it to some guy in Kingman. But then that started the van saga.

That's my Los Angeles story for the day. Anyway, stay tuned.

So I've still been rolling along with online dating and I don't know, you know, start taking

pictures of yourself being like, ah, I can make that picture go a little lower, a little lower.

And you know, what do I need a shirt for? I'll take my shirt off, take a picture of that.

Next thing you know, you know, you've taken it too far. But that brings me to my point is,

uh, uh, where is the content that goes on this phone going when I, let's say, take a picture?

Is it, is it instantly going to, uh, uh, some government organization that's monitoring

every cell phone? I don't know. I might be paranoid, but, uh, yeah, it really seems to be

doing that. Like every single thing you do on a cell phone is being monitored, uh, fiercely.

And, uh, I, uh, I don't know where the law should be on that. Um, you kind of half expect, you know,

whatever you put on there is going to be out there. But, uh, uh, there's a lot of, uh, kind of now the

whole thing doesn't work because you're paranoid about someone monitoring everything. It's like

breaking the system that, uh, that should be functional. So, uh, that would be functional

without over-monitoring. And the most successful video I've had on here was me just ranting about

how I couldn't find a place to sit down because, uh, I was just sensing cameras everywhere. You

know, just I, I took it as government surveillance. You know, the government is watching everything

I'm doing and it's impossible to get comfortable outdoors, uh, because you're always being watched

from a million different angles and sides and how there's not enough people, um, who are able to go

outdoors at all. I mean, look at now this, there's one other guy in this entire area that's outside

and everyone else is in a car. There is no one. It is, uh, it is like downright desolate out here.

Um, and that, okay, there's two guys sitting out there, uh, uh, accepting donations, but, uh, even still

they can only be in those two spots. You know, you can't, you can't just sit down, like I can, I can

comfortably sit down this one spot, but anywhere else it gets, uh, uh, uncomfortable. It's hard to

describe, um, but, uh, look at all the room where people could just sit down, you know, just sit down

and, uh, and, uh, enjoy the outdoors a little bit. But something is really, like, blocking it

and I don't know what it is. The way when COVID-19 was a big thing, um, my way to cope with it is I, I

thought shutting myself indoors would just make the problem worse because, uh, then you're trying to, uh,

just cleanse yourself of all viruses and bacteria, uh, uh, so you don't get sick. Whereas if you go

out in nature, you know, then you're exposed to all the peaceful, uh, bacteria and fungus and virus

that, uh, that has never made you sick before. Um, so, uh, it seemed very strange how everyone, uh,

compensated for that because you could just sit out near, like, a pond or, uh,

uh, swamp area and just sit there and breathe in all the, uh, all the life forms that are living

out there and be fine. I never once got sick during the COVID, uh, pandemic and I never got

vaccinated either. Uh, I have yet to get ill in any way and, uh, uh, I had nothing against, um,

the, the vaccinations in general. It just wasn't an option. I was, I was forced out of my house

during the COVID pandemic, so I had to be outside the entire time. And, uh, had I had more choice

in the situation, um, I would have, uh, probably spent sometimes outdoors, sometimes indoors

just to kind of balance it out. I don't know what jarred me outside so hard. It was about

a year before COVID-19 and I got jammed so hard. I tried not to go bankrupt and, uh, I just got

jammed into Los Angeles and I had to walk around Los Angeles the entire time. Um, but, uh, uh,

continuing further, you know, having this over monitoring of everything outdoors and everything

going into the cell phone is kind of taxing, you know, freedom in general. You know, I, I hate to

sound cliche, but, uh, you know, standing on the people's rights quite a bit, uh, when no one can

go outside and no one can, uh, can have personal data, uh, not accessible by everyone in the world,

or everyone in the federal government, uh, uh, at any time they want. So, uh, I'm gonna keep,

uh, messing around on online dating and see what comes out. Anyway, stay tuned.

So after getting swept up in the Nissan GT-R, I kept looking at Japanese cars and it looks like

there's one faster than I mentioned before. The issue I was having with the GT-R is it has

four-wheel drive and you know even thinking about cars without having one or having any money or

anything still like changes what path you're on. So you know on the Nissan path, on the GT-R path

you know it's four-wheel drive and then you start thinking well where would I need four-wheel drive

then you start moving around trying to justify this four-wheel drive system.

So I started looking at the Lexus LFA which is a you know 10 year old

supercar that Lexus made which is owned by Toyota and the motor out of it is from Yamaha designed

which I really like Yamaha. Like Yamaha is one of my favorite companies. When I was a little kid I

had an XT500 that I couldn't touch the ground on and it was a dual sport enduro.

Some of my best memories are from that bike.

I was so young and it was so a full-size bike that I would have to run it into the shed to

or garage to stop because I couldn't touch the ground so I couldn't hop off the side of it.

That was kind of how my upbringing was. Anyway I owned that thing till I was like 30

and finally sold it and there's a whole story behind that but I had a 2011 Yamaha R1 after it

and the R1 was just like the best little piece of engineering I've ever had. It was like the

engine that was so small and made so much horsepower 1000 cc with 180 horsepower 185

which was a lot. It was a very fast bike so that and all the music they do you know Yamaha is a

very music oriented brand so that brings me back to why I like the LFA. They only made like 500

of them I can't see where I'm going they only made like 500 of them 10 years ago but it is a

one-of-one kind of design and I don't know where they're all sitting. There must be a few in the

United States it would be difficult to keep them running but if you're a good enough mechanic you'd

be able to. Anyway stay tuned!

So, trying to create new interesting content, and it's not as easy as it would seem.

Maybe you think, why doesn't he just go to a car show, or whatever other ideas I have.

All sorts of theatrics, all the possibilities.

It's pretty difficult, you know, having the whole thing operate, to come up with new content.

And I was going through viewing content online, against creating content.

And it's almost like you have to pay for doing stuff by creating.

So the more you create, the more you view.

But it's not an audience of three people, I understand.

But I need more artistic ability.

I'm going to leave this going, because I'm going to run out of space.

So, I was going through all my past, and how different it is from now.

Like how much I've had to open up for myself, and change everything for myself.

What started this whole crusade, is I was trying to clear my name of any crime whatsoever.

Any criminal activity, any criminal association.

Anything against the U.S. military, I wanted to be on the U.S. military's side.

So, being from Nevada, I was born in a state of crime.

You know, everything's crime.

So, having to dig myself out of that, caused most of this situation.

I mean, I might be a farce to play.

But having to dig myself out of that pit, has really got me to where I am.

Trying to explain my life story, so no one has any questions about me.

Or any concerns.

I'm trying to clear any concern, any doubt.

And that's my intent for this social media platform.

But I keep having to adjust to new cities.

You know, I'm still in Austin, and I like Austin.

I don't particularly want to move anywhere.

But I've spent most of my life moving around.

So, I don't know if it's going to take a lot of time to get out of here.

I was looking at employment options.

And the fastest thing I can find in Austin is Washington, D.C.

I don't know if I'm going to go for it.

I still have to wait for my face to clear.

It's still blowing up.

You know, I have a face that likes to blow up.

And it continues to do that.

You know, I can't really go anywhere until it finishes its cycle.

But anyway, stay tuned.

So while searching for new content, I started browsing around online and looking at the police scanners.

And there is one for Travis County where I am.

I don't know what I'd get out of it if I could monitor a police car around here and then show up at the incident or whatever they call it.

And then be able to film some of the action going on.

It might make money, but it also might put me in danger.

That's all I could really get out of the police scanner.

It's just an online radio station for whatever police department is nearby.

I don't have any transportation, so trying to get to where the call would be in enough time to actually get footage of it would be difficult.

But I think I'm well within my rights filming the police.

I don't know where the law is on that.

I would have to look it up.

There's got to be some little clause in there for harassment or something.

But in a public area, if they're conducting an arrest and I'm filming that arrest, I don't know if anything is criminal there.

And it would make money. It would be good footage.

You get to see new stuff on here rather than me talking all the time.

But anyway, stay tuned.

So, I slept most of the day, and what's got me up tonight is digging through all the baggage.

So, I started an online dating account, and this is bringing up my past with online dating,

because it was a major part of the Vegas party thing I did.

And got a few girls off of online dating, and we would go out and party and just have a ball.

It was really fun. You know, late 20s, it was a lot of fun.

I ended up selling this motorcycle while I was dating one of them.

And I don't know if it was her influence on me that encouraged me to sell the motorcycle,

but I had owned that thing for 30 years.

And I didn't have a title for it. My dad gave it to me.

I ended up selling it. I still remember the guy's name who I sold it to.

He was a musician, and I don't know.

You know, now with no transportation whatsoever, it was like, should I have kept that thing?

Should I have worked harder at getting a title for it?

I don't know. And that brings me to my next thing.

How easy it is to track people online.

Because he was just, you know, I sold the motorcycle on Craigslist,

and he called and I gave him a bill of sale and sold the motorcycle.

But I still remember his name for some reason.

So looking back further, you know, in my drinking Vegas party days,

I would drink heavily and then just like spam online, you know, whatever.

And that got me into trouble a few times.

The major time was on Facebook.

I completely ruined my Facebook account because I had been drinking whiskey all night.

And this baggage from high school had carried over.

And I don't want anything to do with anyone from high school.

I like staying out of it.

It's always been a drama swarm.

But baggage had carried over from high school on Facebook

because an acquaintance from high school kept threatening to break into my house.

And he had been doing this for years.

I should have contacted the police and filed a full report about it.

He had made numerous threats before that.

It probably involved this little blonde cheerleader that I dated after high school

and then broke up with and then never wanted anything to do with again.

She was one of the little witchy ones.

I liked avoiding her.

She was impossible to trust.

So I liked avoiding her after that.

I had other girlfriends after her that I was way happier with.

So she was probably in on it.

I don't know what anyone's side of this thing is.

But I had this guy who kept threatening to break into my house.

That was the baggage left over from the thing.

And one night while drinking on Facebook, I decided to Google where he was.

And retaliate for him threatening to break in.

For years I had to put up with this guy threatening to break in.

Finally, I used Facebook as my communication tool and let him know I knew where he was as well.

Cool it with threatening over and over again.

That caused this big blowout.

I decided to just delete my Facebook account and stay off of it.

But I don't know how that thing came to a head in the first place.

I did my best to cool over the situation with peaceful conversation.

But when someone's threatening you over and over again, what do you do?

You can't just sit and wait.

There has to be a way to resolve what could turn into a dangerous situation.

That was my best attempt at smoothing over the situation.

I don't know if there was a better way to handle it.

I would be open to ideas.

Anyway, stay tuned.

So, I've been going through ways to make content, and the easiest way would just be ripping off other people.

You know, just rip off their jokes, their lines, their performance in general.

So I was thinking, well, who could I rip off that wouldn't be noticeable?

And then I gave up on the whole thing.

You know, I didn't even take it that far.

You know, like, I was watching clips from, I was watching old movies on YouTube.

And one of them was Cabin Boy, which is this stupid old movie I saw as a kid.

Chris Elliott was in it, Andy Richer, I think he's on the Conan O'Brien show now.

Andy Richer was in it, and it was funny.

It was just a funny 90s movie.

You know, it didn't try too hard.

I can catch myself thinking jokes from that movie even now, after seeing it.

You know, I haven't seen it in six months now, but when I did, you know, I'm still thinking about jokes from the thing.

And that got me thinking how easy, you know, how many people would catch a joke from Cabin Boy if I told the same thing on here.

And didn't let anyone know it was actually from a 90s comedy.

I then abandoned the idea.

The only thing that really got through when I was thinking about it was Andy Richer, one of the characters in the movie, wrote a map.

He drew a map on a piece of paper, and it was just a line to Hawaii.

And that was the whole map, you know.

And for some reason, that was the funniest thing in the world to me.

I don't know what it is about dumb humor, but that map, they were trying to sail a boat, apparently to Hawaii, and got caught in some storm and then had a bunch of problems.

But that map, you know, it was the worst drawing.

And that's the kind of quality in old movies like that.

I see why Andy Richer has been so famous for so long.

Because something about that stupid map still strikes a chord with me.

So I was thinking about drawing up a map similar to that to get to my escape or something, or whatever I'm trying to get away from.

But that would be ripping off Andy Richer and the cast and crew of Cabin Boy.

So I'm looking for new ideas.

Anyway, stay tuned.

So, uh, not having any money means I have no way to cut my hair and it's getting pretty long.

And I don't know what the best look is because my face hasn't quite cleared.

I don't know what the best hair hairstyle is. I'm not the best at deciding that.

When I was in Vegas, uh, I had it buzzed really short and it, uh, it looked okay. I kind of looked

thuggy with it that way, whereas with it long, you know, just looked like a normal guy. I, uh,

if I had a hair shaver, I'd probably shave it back down to kind of a mid-range length,

but I don't have one. So, uh, I, uh, I am stuck with long hair. Uh, my only other problem is this

jock itch that I'm putting the powder on and doing the whole, whole, uh, process, but it's still just

going and going. And I don't know if it's like some sort of mental thing where I'm,

I'm, uh, uh, having, having bugs that are adding to it, but the jock itch just won't go away.

I think I got it originally from, uh, I dated this Native American woman and I think I got

jock itch from her and just never quite got rid of it. And, uh, she was another one of the online

dating ones when I was like 20. And I thought, you know, can't be that big of a deal. You know,

it steadily, uh, uh, goes away, but it just keeps reoccurring and reoccurring, but the powder on it

doesn't help. Well, it helps a lot, but it doesn't go away completely. So that jock itch is a pain.

Uh, I, I'm out walking right now. I'm trying to get my appetite set correctly. Uh, it's going all

over the place. Uh, it's like I'll either be really hungry or really not hungry and it'll

bounce back and forth. So trying to figure that out. I haven't taken a walk in a while

in a while and I slept all day, so I can't sleep now. So I'm just out walking, uh,

trying to get a little exercise in and, uh, get my legs back in shape. You know,

I'm trying to stay in shape through all of this and, uh, don't need fat legs.

Uh, so having, having walks in there helps that, but, uh, uh, I've been bouncing around this

writing idea, uh, because I've already written so much that, uh, writing jokes would be fun.

I don't know how good I'd be at it. Um, I'd probably need training of some kind.

Uh, it's another one of these paths where maybe I could make a few bucks, uh, helping write for a

sitcom or something. But, uh, uh, because I have no, no options right now other than walking,

you know, it's not very easy. Uh, anyway, that's all I can think about. Stay tuned.

So, you know, after saying I've traveled too much and I shouldn't ever travel again,

I find myself, you know, like mentally wandering to places I've been, and one of them being Central

Florida and going to Disney Springs, which is just out front of Disney World. This was while I was

without a house, and I would just sleep in the brush nearby and then go walk around Disney

Springs and listen to music and just kind of wander around. I was still completely

motivated by, you know, cigarettes across the board, so the only thing I could do is just

walk around and try to find cigarettes, which is kind of a pointless existence because I don't know

how I got myself so addicted to cigarettes in the first place. Now I have vape, Nicored gum,

and cigarettes, and I'm using all three simultaneously to try to quit smoking,

which still hasn't happened. I started smoking when I was like 18, 19, and like everyone says,

it was a dumb idea at the time. A friend of mine who is from Canada started giving me cigarettes,

and that's what started that whole thing. I was able to quit for two years in Vegas,

but then started right back up again. But going back to Central Florida,

I, you know, I couldn't get anything done because I was so addicted to cigarettes, like I couldn't

like motivate myself any other direction besides looking for cigarettes. So it turned into walking

endlessly, everywhere, just trying to find cigarettes. I don't know what got me into that

mental state or how I got so jammed in it where I couldn't get out because I just

had cigarettes for so long, and when I ran out of money, I didn't have them anymore.

And that caused this really, it really showed how awful the addiction was because it was

impossible to get out of it. Even completely homeless on the street, it was impossible to

get away from cigarette addiction. So I would walk until, you know, my shoes would give out

completely, and all sorts of fun stuff, I guess. But I did make it from Kennedy Space Center all

the way to Disney World, which was a good hundred and, it might have been over a hundred miles,

I don't know. It was a long walk. I had to walk the whole way through Orlando, and

I was informing the police of my situation every step of the way, which did nothing.

I tried multiple homeless shelters and never got through because the second that cigarette

thing would go off, I'd just have to walk off and go find cigarettes. And I don't even know what

that cigarette thing is. Like I can't imagine I'm that addicted to them. That's some mental

hook going off in my head that just won't go away. So it's still going on, you know. I'm chewing on

Nicorette gum now, and it seems to slow down the addiction, but it doesn't quite make it go away.

And this is the strong four milligram actual Nicorette gum, not the cheap ripoff one.

And still, I am plagued with trying to quit smoking. And, you know, when you run out of money,

it's the worst thing ever because then you have to go find them out of ashtrays, which is

an awful experience. I don't know if it's because I'm from casinos,

from Nevada and spent a lot of time in casinos, that caused that thing to get so ingrained in

there. Because even as a small child, you know, I would walk around the casinos and

it was always a big part of my upbringing. So I don't know if that had something to do with it.

And just over time, it grew and grew and grew until when I didn't have any money,

all I could do was go try to find cigarettes. Like that was my sole motivation.

If I could have taken steps to avoid that from happening, I sure would have. But

it's still ongoing to this day. I'm fighting this thing like it's a boxing match.

And I'm trying to stay in there because, you know, it can only last so long

being horrifically addicted to nicotine. And it's nicotine in general, too, because I can switch to

vape and just vape and sit there and vape all day and then it goes away. I don't have to go

smoke a cigarette, but I'm having a tough time with the thing. So anyway, stay tuned.

So, uh, still feel like I'm getting dragged out of bed to go smoke a cigarette when I don't want one.

Uh, it's, it's a curse of something, you know. Maybe it's just addiction. Maybe it's a curse.

I don't know. Uh, going back to my childhood, my parents bought a house way, or bought a property

way out in the middle of the Nevada desert. It was close to Fallon Air Force Base, sort of. Like,

you could hear the jets breaking the sound barrier over the house, and it would break windows

sometimes. But, uh, it wasn't that close to Area 51 or Tonopah or any of those. So, uh, I don't know

if these cigarettes have something to do with that. Like, it's too close. It was too close to

military personnel or something, and they like forced cigarettes on anyone nearby. But, uh, this is really

because it's, it's out of control because I have everything jammed against cigarettes. Every possible

thing. I'm in a hotel that, that has blocked smoking across the property. I have a box of

Nicorette gum that's four milligram, uh, the strongest you can get Nicorette gum, and a vape.

And that's still not enough. I still get dragged out of bed to go smoke a cigarette for who knows

what reason. Uh, so I'm going through everything in my past that anyone could possibly have any

questions of, and going through it all. And the first thing that came up was this property in Nevada

that my parents bought and built a house on it. I don't know where they got the money from the

thing or for the thing to buy it. I think it was from my grandfather working as CEO of a tool company

and my dad working as a bush pilot and fur trader and crop duster. And I don't know what else he did.

Um, car dealer, stuff like that. But, uh, uh, not being able to sleep at night for some weird

night tremor is irritating. Uh, I don't know if there's someone trying to question me and unable

to, but, uh, I'm going through every possible little thing I've ever done, had experienced,

and uploading it straight on here for, for anyone to listen. Uh, I'm back out. It's like,

I don't know what time it is. I was laying in bed perfectly comfortably. Um,

I think that's all I got. Anyway, stay tuned.

So, continuing on movies I've watched. As a kid, one of my favorite cartoons was Aladdin,

and they made a live-action version of it that I did see, but it didn't seem to be quite as

memorable. Maybe I'm older, you know, I don't know. As an adolescent youth, that cartoon Jasmine was

the prettiest Disney princess I could think of. And because I spent so much time in Florida,

I went over at Disney World, and that's where all the Disney characters are. And it's fun how good

that brand is bringing up old memories from their cartoons. But speaking further of Aladdin,

you know, I started thinking, you know, what if Jafar won? Like, if Jafar defeated Aladdin,

became sultan, and got Jasmine? And what he would have done to that poor monarchy,

or kingdom, or whatever it was. But he seemed to be, you know, what I got stuck at

was he had spent years as, like, a loyal second command to the sultan. You know, he had been there

for years doing his job, you know, maintaining the kingdom. And suddenly, I don't know if Jasmine,

like, spell-casted him or something, and that caused him to, like, turn on the whole thing.

But something really struck a chord there. Like, all of a sudden, he decides to turn on the entire

kingdom. And Aladdin, you know, he was going around robbing everyone, so he didn't seem like

the best guy to, like, lead that big of a country. Because, you know, in the beginning, he's just

stealing bread, and running from the cops, and doing all sorts of not-leader-material

behavior. And so, putting him with the princess would then make him the leader.

And so, then you have a kingdom of people getting robbed, and all sorts of hooliganism.

Whereas Jafar, you know, it'd probably be like this militant, you know,

monarchy. I don't know which one the better one is, you know, when you really, like,

get into the characters. And I guess because Jafar wasn't the best match for Jasmine,

I don't know what age that character is supposed to be. I mean, you could get a

35-year-old Jasmine going, and looking pretty good. That was always the prettiest character. So,

you know, 35, 40, she could still pull it off. So, saying he was too old, it was like, well,

just find an older Jasmine, and then be good to go. This Aladdin character, you know, that is

a lot of crime going into the thing. You know, and then all of a sudden, he finds a lamp,

and becomes prince. And he stole the lamp in the first place, you know. It wasn't his, he stole it,

and then made himself prince. So, there's a lot of theft going on, on the Aladdin side of things.

And an age difference on the Jafar side, but it seems like he could have fixed the Jafar side,

just point him at a different girl, or get Jasmine out of there. You know, the part of it,

you know, it seems like they all started to turn on each other,

as they became more and more involved in what Jasmine was doing.

So, I don't know what she was doing on her side. It seems like you could remedy the situation a

little better, without this princess willing to get with anyone that's nearby. But all that said,

you know, it was a very good movie, a memorable movie. And someday, I hope to see it again. I

haven't seen the cartoon in forever, but I saw the live action a little while ago.

And it was always the snake cobra staff that struck it hard. Jafar's cobra staff.

I always thought that was pretty cool. You know, you could mind control people with it.

And the cobra snake, I don't know where they mostly are. I saw they were in South Africa.

It's a really interesting type of snake. They stand up on their, I want to say, well,

I guess they stand up on their stomach. But they stand up a few feet tall and look really menacing.

Everywhere I'm from, you know, there's just rattlesnakes everywhere. So everything,

and those are vipers. So the cobras are more interesting to watch than the vipers.

But rattlesnakes are interesting too. Anyway, stay tuned.

Just out here watching the cars go by.

I've been thinking about all my experience with cars over the years.

All sorts of trucks, cars, motorcycles, small engines. What brought this up is I remember

when I was a little kid I had one of those motorized scooters. It was just like the

one from Dumb and Dumber that they rode to Aspen. It had a little three horsepower engine on it,

a little Briggs and Stratton engine. That engine was really reliable.

I don't think it ever gave me a serious issue. I rode that thing around for a few years.

Later when I grew up I bought a motorized bicycle with another three horsepower engine,

but it had the Kubova or something motor on it. That thing lasted like a month and gave

out completely. So the Briggs and Stratton was much better as far as little engines go.

But I got good at messing around with little engines when I was a kid because I would play

around with that Briggs and Stratton or we had a water pump and I'd take apart the water pump engine.

But that was before we moved. Once we moved then I got real motorcycles like a Trail 70

and I kept those things running for years. I had a Trail 70 and then the other Honda was a CR250

which was a two-stroke dirt bike that made like 60 horsepower or something which was a lot for

a dirt bike. I kept the motor running in that thing for 10 to 15 years. I never really had

an issue with it. It would start easily and run strong. It would burn through all its gas. It had

no range whatsoever. It was a good dirt bike. My favorite motorcycle I ever had was this XT500. I

talked about here before. That made me a Yamaha fanboy. I had a 2011 R1 too, but riding on the

street is too dangerous. So dirt bikes are safer because if you go down on a dirt bike you're not

hitting much. You're just hitting the dirt. Not hitting a car or guardrail or semi truck at 80

miles an hour. So I used to have a motorcycle license but it's probably expired by now because

I switched driver's license states and when I switched states I didn't get the motorcycle

endorsement on the new state. So I don't know how that works exactly but I'm pretty sure

I would have to retake the whole motorcycle exam. As far as cars, I've worked on trucks mostly but

just simple like serpentine belts, valve covers, spark plugs,

transmission flush.

Seeing how everyone is in a car right now, which I've said before, people really like cars.

I was looking online on ideas of what content to make on here and anything lightweight seems to be

where we're headed. Cars are at 4,000 pounds and they could be

1,500 pounds. You could bring down the weight of a car a lot.

So once we get through this battle of who has the heavier thing rolling down the road,

everything getting lighter will probably be the direction

transportation goes in. I was going through my past in boating. Because I'm from the desert,

boating is really difficult because there's like three lakes and 200 miles. So

boating is really difficult. Now that I'm in Texas, there's a lot more lakes and a lot more

water and boating seems a lot more common and easier to access. But I don't quite know what the

agreement on fishing is. I was going to just avoid fishing entirely and have a boat that

you can just scuba dive and snorkel on and kind of take underwater photography and film wildlife

and stuff like that. That was one of my little ideas that, you know, if I get everything squared

away, I'd love to go try. But as far as boating is concerned, you know, those big heavy gas guzzler

yachts, you know, you can use them for five minutes and then you run out of gas. Those little lightweight

speed boats, you know, if you put a small engine on one of them so it doesn't use any gas,

you could like cruise around everywhere and have a ball with the thing and not use any gas. You know,

everyone's going on about global warming, so having the smallest lightest thing might be

the more successful option. Whether it's a motorcycle, a car, a truck, a boat,

using the least amount of gas probably gets you the farthest. So anyway, stay tuned.

So, strained on food. I've been eating ramen noodles for my entire life, and I think I'm clunking like

through some kind of gear because I may have to go get Taco Bell or something. I'm having

trouble eating ramen noodles, and I've always eaten ramen noodles. You know, it's never,

never changed, so I don't know what that's about. I do have a few bucks, but not much,

and I was trying to save it for vape because I'm still addicted to nicotine. I'm chewing the

nicorette gum and reducing cigarettes as much as I possibly can, but I'm trying to save my money

for vape so I don't run out completely and have to go searching for cigarettes. But as far as

food goes, you know, I only have so many options at Walmart when I walk in there, and this last

week I had to buy shavers so that that gouged into my food supply, and all I have in the

the apartment is cereal and ramen noodles and cheese. So I have to figure out what to do about

it. I had a frying pan or multiple frying pans that I was using, but I ended up donating them

to Goodwill because I was using some old hamburger system that I learned when I was

really young. You know, you could make hamburgers on the frying pan on the grill or on the stove,

but I don't know if there was something wrong with that. I'm trying to get into infrastructure

correctly so, like, all my food supply is set correctly and everything in infrastructure the

way it should be, and I don't know what it is about that that frying pan, but it seemed outlawed

in some way because I used that system since I was a little kid. It was ingrained way in there,

and I don't know if it's, like, the wrong way to heat hamburgers. You know, I was just buying

hamburger meat at the store and then frying it on the pan and then making my own hamburgers.

Because I'm from, like, the ranch system, that was always the ranch way to do it.

Uh, maybe there's some other way. I don't know. I, uh, I wish there was people I could ask,

but, uh, they're, you know, it's difficult from the spot I'm in. You know, my face is all chewed

up. I'm sitting on the side of the road with no money, so there's, like, no one I can ask

to learn what the best path to take, especially what food to buy, so I'm not, like,

uh, in the wrong category from where I should be. So it's really complicated to learn.

I'm, uh, I'm doing my best, mostly trial and error. You know, I got stuck in that Mountain Dew

thing forever, and I don't know, uh, if I change my food supply, then if I'm eating different food,

that reduces, uh, wanting Mountain Dew. Um, I'm still, like, trying to figure it out.

Anyway, stay tuned.

So what started this whole thing is I was sitting on the side of the road with a sheet of cardboard

in a spot very similar to this in central Florida and I got the idea you know why not just tell my

story into the camera and see what comes out. So the whole like thing started with that.

I got the idea because I made a joke to myself that you know you got guys yelling at cars out

here and yelling at everyone. I thought why don't you just yell into your cell phone and see what

comes out. I mean there's not a lot to lose from it if you're already sitting on the side of the

road anyway. You know you can yell in there and all the like social network embarrassment kind

of goes away because it's not really there. You know you're not sitting high enough in the water

for it to really affect you and you could get all sorts of skits going in spots like these.

So that's what started my content creation endeavor and at that point I was already

like I had a tablet and I would sit on open wi-fi networks and just watch TikTok when I was bored

and it worked pretty well. It was entertaining and this was right when TikTok started or pretty

close to it. I couldn't like film a video of myself right when I got the thing

because I don't know I guess I was just embarrassed to have the camera on me or something

but it took like a year and a half to finally get the camera to turn around so it was facing

me and not facing someone else. That's when the whole thing started. I then ended up

getting a hotel room and just kept uploading videos of whatever I was thinking that day

and that seemed to get the motor running. I am still looking for ideas to put in here.

The difficulty is you know you run out of stories you run out of ideas and

videos to make so I'm always kind of fishing around for new stuff to put in here. There's

a lot of room for street performers and all sorts of outfits. You know I told the story before

uh why can't people dress in costumes out on the side of the road it would draw more attention.

I don't know if it classifies distracting traffic or what but if it were up to me you know there'd

be a lot more street performers. Because I'm from like the extreme rural Nevada and casinos

and stuff like that even standing on the side of the road with a sheet of cardboard is an

improvement. It's so much crime out there that having the police presence nearby is a benefit.

So I had to climb for 30 years to get to the level of sitting on the side of the road with

a sheet of cardboard. That's how low those casinos sit. They are completely against the

U.S. government and against establishment and everything to do with it. So I had to

dig myself out of the whole thing which was not easy and because my dad was a pilot

I had to stop like anything to do with aircraft to to stay away from aviation altogether because

it wasn't making money it was getting strongly discouraged and my dad was never there because

of the airplane. You know if he didn't have the airplane I probably would have had a dad growing up.

So I always didn't like it very much and that was more debt I had to like

earn to pay off was just being able to sit stationary and not move around all over the place.

So that added to the baggage that I had to sit on the side of the road to to clear out.

And I don't know I'm always open to ideas on here.

I started a LinkedIn account and now I'm fishing around on LinkedIn to see

what content creator opportunities are available. I've worked a lot of retail

but the whole thing kind of caved in on me. I think I was too close to the casinos

when I was working retail. I worked for Circuit City and I was one of the fire dog in-home techs

so it was like geek squad only not. And the whole brand went under but we weren't

taking the job very seriously. It was a pretty big party. I ended up dating a co-worker

and we had all sorts of fun for like four years but that relationship fell apart.

And I don't know if dating a co-worker got me in trouble with the rest of the retail world.

It was it seemed like a good idea at the time I'll put it that way.

And because Circuit City was was going out of business we thought it was pretty funny.

I think it's because when we worked see we we would work the store and then go out and to the

clubs and drink in the casinos all night. And that's how I initially started dating her. So

having the casinos that close kind of pitched down the the retail engine to the point where

where co-workers became available. And while it being a lot of fun I probably would well I don't

even know if I'd do it differently. You know it went really well. I made a lot of money.

She did ended up cheating on me. I think it went against all of all of infrastructure for doing

that but we did have a good time. I would have filmed that whole thing too had I known how to

record myself which I didn't. I was working I was doing just in-home pc repair small business

uh network servers stuff like that. So I never had a camera pointed at me. It took forever to

get used to it. So now I'm still just learning as I go. Anyway stay tuned.

So, as I've said before, I've been staying in a weekly hotel room for the past year, year and a

half, and I haven't even used my spare key. You know, it's sitting at the front desk and

it's never been used. You know, I just keep my main one and then I call them when I need it

reactivated. So, it's been sitting there a while and I was scrolling through TikTok and,

man, some of the girls on there or on here, I should say,

you know, they could get access to that second key. I'm trying to stay

as motivated towards a committed future as possible. That's why picking up girls

and dragging them to a hotel room doesn't seem like the best way to accomplish that goal.

There must be a story behind this thing.

Someone appears to have parked their car on the other side of the sidewalk.

But, anyway, back to what I was going at. You know, back in my Vegas days,

get hotel rooms all the time, have a ball with whatever girl, but that really got me in trouble.

That's part of what got me in the situation that I'm still digging myself out of,

is making that too easy and just having these little one-night stand flings.

And then the problem with it is, you know, you do all this work and then you have like,

you know, you go out for two weeks or something and never see them again. And then you're stuck.

You got one more notch against you and it didn't amount to anything. The relationship

doesn't last, you know, it falls apart almost instantly because no work was put into it

beforehand. So, despite being tempted by having that spare hotel room key and just like trying

to invite women over, I'm really hesitant about it because it would just cause more problems.

Every single one of them, when I was doing that in Vegas, every single one of them had like

an ex-boyfriend or a cousin or brother or dad who was very

motivated by where they were and what they were doing. So, it just turned into a fight every single time.

And when I got older, I started to realize it just wasn't worth the work to put into it for

these little one-night stands. I tried, you know, I've only had one girlfriend in my past that had

any length to it. Well, all right, I shouldn't say that. Three or four girlfriends in my past that had

some length. And every single one of them, you know, I had to go through this all-out brawl

with some guy because they were mad about us dating each other. And I just got tired of getting

in that brawl over and over again. So, despite even having a spare hotel room key,

I don't feel like getting in a brawl with anyone over some girl. Maybe when I get myself a little

cleaned up and higher on the totem pole, where it doesn't just instantly turn into a

fight with some guy, I'll open the door a little more. But as far as right now, you know, I'm

gonna stay. I've been like a hermit shut in as much as I possibly can.

And it is peaceful. You know, the one thing I get out of it is just peacefulness.

I partied so much when I was younger that now it's just like reading the Bible and like playing

old video games and listening to some music. Although, I'm trying to shut out the music even

because I got tired a bit. I'm gonna walk back over to this car that appears to have parked itself

in the grass. I don't know if anyone's even here.

It looks like they hit the fence pretty good.

That must have been a DUI. I don't think anyone's in it. It's all torn down.

And sitting on the side of the road, that is a interesting place to park.

And the window's broken out of it, so they must have stolen it. I'm gonna call the cops.

Anyway, stay tuned.

So this Nevada, California thing, I can't believe how much rivalry and like dispute there is between

Nevada and California. I am originally from Northern Nevada, which I've said before,

but everything TV and film seems to revolve around California, and I can't get through

one way or the other. I'm trying not to walk into the road because I have so much light on me right

now. I just got new batteries for this camera's light, and now it's much brighter. You know,

it has served its purpose and is much brighter. Anyway, what I was talking about is the Nevada,

California thing. I don't even know what started it. Like, maybe thousands of years ago,

when the Native Americans, Mexicans, all the tribes fighting with each other,

they might have set up some kind of a division along the Sierra Nevada mountains, and that like

carried through to modern civilization. That's as far as I could get with the idea.

But this thing is still going on, and like, because I'm doing this content creator so much,

and being from Nevada, that instantly turns into this rivalry with California that I'm not

intentionally doing. You know, I don't have any issue with California or Californians.

It's another pretty part of the country to me, but every one of my little mechanisms and habits

and ways of doing things are all based from Nevada. Well, mostly. There's a little Alaska

in there, but mostly from Nevada. And that seems to conflict with the way California does things,

with the way California does things. And I'm trying, you know, I wish I could smooth over this

whole thing and let everyone get along and, you know, all that hippie stuff. But it just doesn't

seem to work every time. And what I'll catch myself doing is I'll, like scrolling on TikTok,

for instance, and then one of the girls on there will be from California. And that starts up the

whole thing of this conflict. And if I have pulled it off before where I dated a woman who was from

Southern California, but it caused everything to implode in Nevada. And I've seen other relationships

where one will be from Nevada and the other will be from California. And it always turns into like

this abusive kind of mess. And they never seem to work it out. So I have to keep trying. I don't know.

The biggest thing that's drawn me is because I'm doing so many videos on here, I'm trying to learn

how to make successful content. And Southern California, you know,

that's how Hollywood is always what you think of when you think successful film production.

And for me, you know, I end up in that Nevada, California conflict every time I try to kind of

hustle my way in there. I did have some success in Beverly Hills, but I was homeless the entire

time. You know, I didn't have a place. The only success I really had in there was I was able to

use the library to receive an email that allowed access to money. And then I just used that money

to go straight to Arizona. I didn't even spend anything in California. It was just straight to

Arizona and then camped out near Lake Havasu. But I wish this thing would calm down or

or we'd find some resolution for it because it's been going on for a long time.

And it's now in the way of my income because I could learn a lot about film production from the

people in Southern California. But with that from Nevada thing going off over and over again,

it sets off their alarm too. So anyway, stay tuned.

So, while talking on here, I started tiptoeing into the world of marketing, which I have no

understanding of. There are a few followers on this channel, but it's not, you know, it's just me

telling my life story and explaining my plight. So, the whole world of marketing is extremely

foreign to me. I've never really done any advertising or had any involvement with

any advertisement companies. I was always on the techie, computer repair side. So,

I would do sales. I did sales for a few, just retail stores, nothing that major.

But, because this thing, you know, the tech industry doesn't really need repairmen anymore.

It used to a lot more. It used to be a lot more

problematic. Now, these things, especially with Chrome OS and these Android phones,

it lasts almost indefinitely the way it sits. So, you don't need anyone coming out repairing

the thing every five minutes, whereas before it was much more difficult to maintain functionality.

This would have been like 10 years ago. So, I tried to adapt myself to the

industry, and that is buying the cheapest device possible. In this case, it's just a track phone,

and I'm still going on about how expensive some phones are versus how cheap others are.

And what you're getting for the money, like $600 for a phone and, I don't know, $100 a month

payment plan, whereas this thing is $30 for the phone and, I don't know, $15 a month,

if that even, and maybe even down to $6 a month. It's extremely inexpensive.

And this unlimited data that seems to be the biggest sales pitch of cell phones, I've been

doing Wi-Fi networks forever. And so, I don't even use the cell phone data at all. I just connect to

Wi-Fi where I am and use the Wi-Fi instead. And it's always been faster and more reliable and

cheaper. And part of what I'm thinking is this mobile data thing just makes people

want to be more mobile. I don't know what the best path society should take is, but

there's a lot of room for negotiation and communication and all sorts of settling

disputes with this new technology we all now have. So, I took the path of

learning how to explain my situation as clearly as possible and being able to allow a way for

people to learn from what I've been through and everything I've done and all of that. So,

that's kind of the way I'm steering my whole operation, whereas before it was all just

computer repair, IT repair, car repair, just repairing whatever.

So, I don't know. I sure made a lot more money doing repair, but

the whole thing kind of switched to learning from my plight. And part of the problem with

what I was going through before is there was all sorts of crime baggage sitting on the thing.

That there were crimes I didn't commit, but there was no way to prove that. And so,

the motive for starting explaining my life story on this thing was to have a new internet

so everyone knew exactly where I've been, exactly what I've been doing,

and I wouldn't get implicated or falsely accused of a crime I had nothing to do with.

And furthermore, adding to this, my parents and grandparents never told their life story or

explained what they were doing throughout their entire existence. So, that was all the baggage

that landed on me, and then I had to somehow explain for three generations what happened.

And that's not the easiest thing in the world. So, that's why every time I have a thought,

I'm just going outside, bring the cell phone, and saying everything I'm thinking at that time.

And with any luck, you know, I may pull through. I don't know. I was thinking, you know, doing

product placement on this thing, but I don't know how to get sponsors. I don't even know where to

begin. I mean, if you want to be a sponsor, just put your company in the comments, and I'll put

your product on this channel. That's the best I can do with marketing. Anyway, stay tuned.

So, after being in electronics for so long, in IT, and watching the market like change around a hundred different ways,

I've been seeing how the computer industry has kind of fallen down.

You know, it's not, it's not what it used to be, you know.

They're really reliable, they last a long time, you don't need to repair them or replace them.

So, there's not a lot of money there.

But I've been watching the cameras, old cell phone cameras and digital SLRs and video cameras,

and that still appears to be making money.

There's a camera shop here in Austin I walked into one time, and it looked like it was pretty busy.

This was shortly after coming out of Goodwill, where Goodwill had this used computer section,

where they were just refurbishing old computers.

And the Goodwill, that whole section shut down completely, like they don't even have it anymore.

But the Precision Camera, the cameras store was really busy.

So, that's probably where the money is.

I think because everything's so reliable now, everyone's just looking for content to put on the screen,

instead of having to repair the existing device.

So, making content is the place to be.

It's more difficult than it seems.

It seems like you could just point your cell phone at something, record it, and upload it.

But there's a little more process to it.

Like, I have to pre-think about these stories for hours beforehand,

and then just kind of talk them in here when I get it all put together.

And the premise, you know, starting the premise for the whole thing.

But I've been thinking about those cameras.

The other thing I'm thinking about, about those cameras,

is the camera I'm using now is on a BlueView 2 track phone,

which is the cheapest phone you can get.

I think it's $30 new.

And it has some focusing problems,

but using it on a platform that's for other cell phones,

you can barely notice the difference.

It's a little blurry, and focusing, you know, it doesn't focus quite as well.

But the razor-sharp cameras that you're spending a fortune on,

how long is it going to take for all the cell phones to do what the computer industry did,

where they get so advanced that there's no way to improve upon them?

And then you're stuck in the same loop that happened to the computer industry.

So spending $30 on a cell phone camera, or $600, you know,

what are you getting for the money,

and how long are you going to keep making money selling hardware?

So I'm going to stick to content creation and see if I can learn how film production works.

I'm going through the film production crash course while I'm doing this,

pre-rehearsing what I'm going to say,

and trying to speak in an interesting way with interesting content.

So anyway, stay tuned.

So I was going to take the bus down to Mueller Lake Park and go to the bar and ask for a glass of water

and see what's going on. And the bus system on Sunday night is so unreliable.

So I looked at the last bus I was leaving when I left my apartment. It was 11 30 or something

like that or 11. And then while I was on the bus I decided to check to see when the return bus,

when the last return bus was coming back to the hotel. And they had all been canceled.

So I would have been left stranded all night down at Mueller Lake Park because the bus, there's no

way to predict when it's going to be there or when it's not. And Sunday nights seem to be the worst

for it. The other nights it seems to be okay but you don't know when they're going to cancel or

what they're going to do. So I can't make it down to the park, which I was going to try to get a

video of the bar and the park and all my commentary on everything. But it looks like that's out.

The other thing is, you know, I scanned my bus ticket. It was inactive and now it's scanned and I won't

be on the bus. So that was a waste of a bus ticket and a waste of $11 because now it's active

for the whole week when I was just going to go one time. It really is a difficult system to use

if you're trying to get anywhere in any reasonable amount of time. It is difficult to get the bus

to be there when you need it and leave when you need it.

So I'm going to keep working on transportation. Anyway, stay tuned.

I noticed there were fireflies. I hadn't seen any fireflies the entire time I've been here.

I thought they were all farther north, but apparently there's fireflies here. So

they are a completely foreign thing for me because extreme desert, you know, there isn't

there isn't even many insects, you know, there's nothing. The first time I saw fireflies, I think

I was in Iowa with my cousins and saw them flying around all over and it made an impression on me

as a kid. And then I lived in Nebraska for a while and saw them there, but it was nice to

see to get to see a few in Texas. They seem pretty far south, but they were blinking around.

They're always the most interesting insects because their ability to light up

is unique to say the least. And they're fun to watch, you know, see them zipping around.

Anyway, stay tuned.

I'm standing down at a different park and this one it's a lot bigger

but there's not a lot going on. There's people walking around it

it's going you know because I'm gonna be up all night I'm just restless so I'm gonna sit here and

watch the water maybe maybe something interesting will turn up. I'm always kind of looking around

for footage that people will find interesting. It is pretty right here as you can see the

Austin skyline but I'll get a pan of it but I don't quite know what to do with myself tonight.

It it's a lazy evening. I'm still waiting for my face to clear.

I'm just getting the last of the little bumps out of it because

once they're all clear then I just won't have acne at all

which and the only thing that created it in the first place was me squeezing my

zits too much and that that caused him to swell up so once I dig out the last of it I'll just be

a normal guy. I'm gonna keep walking around here and and see if there's anything of interest that's

worth filming. It's been pretty slow like I'm not walking into events very much that are worth

videoing. I saw you know I could just like find any place the police are and start recording

but I don't want to upset the police. I really like having them around and it seems like that

would get annoying after a while so I'm gonna keep like half looking for wildlife and half

looking for interesting stories. Anyway stay tuned.

So, I saw everyone was getting swept up in Formula 1 in Miami, and there's a Formula 1 track here in

Austin. The Formula 1 race isn't until October, I think. I brought my computer out here with me,

but the next race is May 17th, 19th, and it's the GT Championship. I'm more interested in the GT.

I like Formula 1, but I also like seeing the real cars, you know, the cars you see on the

street racing around. I wish they would go back to that, you know. In the beginning, stock car racing

was, you used stock manufactured cars to race around the track, and over the years it transformed

into its own, like, race, and now it's NASCAR. Well, a lot of these others are the same thing.

GT racing, you know, it's still sort of a street car, although mostly a race car. I always like

the street cars. You drive them straight off the street and onto the track and see how they do.

So, I don't have a way to get to Circa de Americas. I tried the Austin bus system

and the closest it gets is like six miles away, and it requires a bunch of transfers. I don't even

know how to transfer over there. So, it's a good walk at the end of the bus line, and it would take

a few hours on the bus line and then a few hours walk, so it would be like five hours total time

to get there and then like five hours back. So, not the easiest endeavor from where I am currently,

but MotoGP, you know, I used to have a Yamaha R1, and I bought it new from Yamaha.

That got me sort of into MotoGP, but I never raced that bike around the track.

It wasn't the fastest one that year, but I always liked the musical Yamaha R1

theme of that bike, so that's why I bought that one. It was a good bike. It still kind of,

I have to tell the story about it, but may earn a little in MotoGP,

and so maybe it will get my foot in the door there before any of the race car ones.

I've worked security for big events, and some of that might carry over because it's another

big amphitheater, although I was, you know, part of the reason I'm doing this is to

broaden my horizons away from having to do security. So,

looking at content creation and new content to create,

Circuit of the Americas is a lot of room for videographers.

I don't know. Once I find transportation to get there, it'll be a lot easier. Anyway, stay tuned.

So I've been going through this thing and all the weird problems you can have with it.

Mostly stalkers and anyone stalking anyone else. I don't know where the line on stalking is.

Like if you watch a video and then get influenced by the video,

like scooters for instance. My latest one was scooters. I watched one of the clips and it was

a pretty girl with a scooter and I immediately zeroed in on the scooter. I don't know what that

is but I was thinking about scooters after that and all sorts of ways to modify them

and all the things, all the fun you can have with the scooter. I don't know because her influence

initially started that. I don't know if that's somehow taking from her image.

Like if I watch a clip of scooters and then go like try to research scooters, is that taking

somehow? And then going back to the stalking thing, if I want more scooters,

trying to contact that person would then be stalking. So it's kind of bracketed all weird

because there's no avenue to take. It's taking if you go straight to the scooters

and then it's stalking if you contact the person. So I'm trying to find. And then on top of that,

I have the double thing going because some of these views get pretty popular

and who knows who's stalking me in there. You know, they could be anywhere. Look,

I could be getting followed right now and wouldn't even know it. They could be anywhere.

So I don't know what to do about all these people stalking me.

You know, it's got to be pretty big by now. I'm kidding mostly but

it does create a paranoia that, you know, it'd be nice to undo or soften. I think communication,

I've just been trying to work on communication this entire time. Communication with anyone I'm

trying to learn something from or get something from or work with or anything like that.

So as far as the stalkers go, you know, it's probably pretty difficult and I'm probably

just trying to skip a bracket. But man, I have always liked scooters and I could go on for a

month about what a good idea scooters are. See, I got the stalker paranoia going on.

But anyway, you know, because I've been so obsessed with

fuel economy and saving money and not throwing anything away,

that scooter thing really struck a chord. In Mexico, I think scooters are everywhere. There's

a lot more of them. In the United States, there's not as many. So I wish there were more scooters

in the United States. I would have, if it were up to me, this is another thing, if I were in power,

I would almost have dedicated roads, dedicated lanes to two-wheel vehicles so that you can

get around on very little money. Especially scooters because they're like, you know,

you get a hundred miles to the gallon on one of those things and it's really lightweight and

cheap and easy and it doesn't chew up the roads like all these heavy cars.

But going back to all these stalkers, you know, when I start thinking about stalkers too much,

I can just go sit out here and, you know, be fine. Because, you know, where are they all?

Who are they all? It's the social media paranoia that seems to form.

And when you're sitting out here, you know, the biggest, and there is worry there, you know,

everyone's kind of half flipping out all the time. But they're not really after you, you know,

they have their own problems, they're going through their own stuff. So as long as you don't

like become a, you know, interact or become too aggressive with anyone, you'll probably be okay.

I just dodge around, you know, I kind of stay out of everyone's way and try to avoid any

confrontation. But the social media stalker paranoia is evident. You know, I can see it

when I'm in my hotel room, like, oh no, what if someone saw this video and is going to show up

at my front door with some sort of intent I don't want, you know, some sort of negative intent.

So I can see that growing. But because I was homeless for three years,

you know, it's like, what the, you know, what are they doing now?

I can just sit out here and it goes away almost instantly. It just disperses back into nature.

So I don't know, I'm getting more paranoid about contacting the wrong person or trying to

start a conversation with the wrong person on there and getting in trouble.

Um, because I've been meticulous about not getting arrested and not committing any crimes or,

uh, and not being associated with anyone committing any crimes. So I'm like tiptoeing

through everything right now, uh, while I get a little more, uh, uh, credentials and,

and, uh, a little more of my backstory, uh, told to everyone so they know where I'm coming from.

But, uh, uh, anyway, stay tuned.

So, for some reason Cash App wasn't notifying me, but I had received a few donations in the past

two weeks or so, and I just want to say thank you to everyone who donated. It was about 50 bucks

total, but it was, you know, that's very helpful. I was, I think I had or have $40 and that's all I

had, and I was saving that for vape. I'm trying to stick to this Nicorette gum and resist the

temptation to buy cigarettes because I've had way too many cigarettes in my lifetime. I never need

another cigarette for anything. It, it's been too much of a curse. So, I want to say thank you once

again for the donations. I went out and got Taco Bell with it, with some of the money, and it was,

you know, when you haven't had fast food in a while, it always tastes like the best food ever.

So, it tasted pretty good. I think, maybe I had Taco Bell a week ago or something, but

it was really good. Secondly, going live, I have the worst Wi-Fi connection in the hotel room. I

mean, it is the slowest. It's unstable. I have to connect and reconnect all the time. So, going live

is pretty wild out because I don't have data on this cell phone. It's just,

like, 500 minutes, 500 texts. It's just a little track phone that doesn't,

uh, doesn't have all the bells and whistles. So, uh, I can't go live. I would if I could,

but, uh, I don't even know if I'd have enough to say to go live because, uh, you know, the,

even a five-minute clip, I'm having to, uh, uh, plan ahead before saying what I want to say.

I don't know how the other guys do it on here. Props to them, uh, for being able to talk that long

and, uh, and keep the entertainment value up. So, until I get a better data connection,

uh, I'm stuck with these little clips that I just upload with the Wi-Fi. And sometimes it takes

20, 30 minutes or longer, uh, for a video to upload. Um, and that's like a three-minute video.

Uh, so, you know, I'm dealing with really slow internet speeds. Uh, I'm out walking around again.

Um, I was, uh, I was entertaining different possibilities, uh, of how to make content on

here and how to have new interesting footage. I don't know. You know, the best I can come up with

is trying to find wildlife and recording it. Um, I have, you know, I've said this before, but

20 years ago I was a, a licensed scuba diver. Uh, so that does carry over. You know, I can renew

my scuba diving license, but I would need investments, investors and sponsors and all of

that. And then an underwater camera and recording all the wildlife down there. Um, that would be

really good footage and I would have a ball making it. Um, even snorkeling, uh, you know, I've swam

quite a bit in my life, but because I'm in Austin, I'm nowhere near the beach. So, uh, that may be,

uh, maybe on the back burner for now. Um, Austin is doing such a good job at pulling me through,

uh, every little quirk I have that, uh, uh, I don't want to abandon it just yet until I get

through everything. Uh, everything that I think is too far past threshold. And the only two things

that are going past threshold are addiction to cigarettes and night insomnia and night

restlessness. Um, everything else is minor. Uh, oh, and acne. You know, once I get through the

last of the acne, then that'll be, uh, the, the end of it. But, uh, once those are done, you know,

I don't know, uh, where I'll end up, you know, I may end up in a different bracket.

Uh, so a different spot, you know, there's no way to predict what's, uh, what's gonna happen.

Um, I'm always looking for, for new content ideas. Um, I saw there's a lot of popularity

recording cars, but it also seems like really nice cars, you know, people don't want to see these,

uh, these normal traffic cars driving by. So I don't have much footage of, uh, of nice cars.

I saw, uh, clips of the Met Gala going on. And, uh, unfortunately I don't have any fashion sense

whatsoever. So, you know, I've burned a cigarette, burned green sweatshirt and

shirt that I've been wearing for the past year. Um, and that's my level of fashion.

Uh, maybe someday I'll, uh, I'll be able to get, get into what all this fashion is about.

But that Met Gala sure was impressive. Uh, they, they put a lot of effort into those,

uh, those outfits. So it was interesting to see the few little clips I saw here on TikTok.

Um, I'm going to keep chugging along anyway. Stay tuned.

I don't know if this counts as wildlife, but here's a dog sitting over here.

He's peering at me over the pole. I don't know if I should walk over there.

He was running up when I turned the camera on, but now he's hiding behind that pole.

So you can see him peering up. That probably doesn't classify as wildlife. He probably just

wants food anyway. I tried walking over to a different spot just to get some new footage.

I'm too motivated to be out right now.

So it's funny to think about because I'm just kind of plopped in a random

spot in Austin, Texas.

You know, it's almost just wherever I sit down is where I am.

I've been doing this for a while. I've been everywhere,

like all over the West Coast, Alaska,

California, Florida. When I had a van, I did the whole country. I think I went to

every state except for Delaware, Rhode Island maybe. There's a few, you know, those little

tiny ones are still out. But I went to every other state and then I cardboarded around with the van

for like six months where I just parked the van in a parking lot and then sit with cardboard on

the side of the road and get enough money for gas and then go like 30 miles and sit at the next spot.

I did that all over the country. Well, actually, I should say I did that from Arizona

to Florida and then I went around Florida everywhere and then the van got towed

because I think people don't like you doing that. I'm now just walking down this

empty parking lot for no reason.

Not getting followed by that dog. There's a lot of old

abandoned, like there's an abandoned restaurant right there. I don't know what this thing is.

Some, oh, it's a church. Red Rocks Church. I do like reading the Bible, but I haven't gone into

church very much. And I don't know because I keep bouncing around so much, you know,

you almost need a drifter church, which I don't even know if they exist.

All of these are like community ones. So I keep wishing I'll see some of those raccoons or possums

or anything of interest, but there never is anything. It's like 2 or 3 a.m. right now,

so it's only me out here and my legs are restless. I once again woke up in the middle of the night.

I went to sleep at like 8.30 and then woke up at 11. I was able to get back to sleep barely

and then slept till like 1.30 and then was completely wide awake. So my nights are still off.

I'm trying not to walk into anything here.

But I'm gonna keep looking for footage and see what shows up. Anyway, stay tuned.

So I've been watching these protests go off everywhere, and I've always been on Israel's

side. I like the fact that Israel is an independent country, and all it took for them to become

independent. Now I know there's, there may be a little extra aggression going on, and

reducing that aggression would reduce the conflict. So whatever the conflict is. The

Russia-Ukraine war was the same thing. It was too much aggression, and led to conflict,

and then what? So I wish I could reduce conflict all over, and reduce aggression, and everyone

would be peaceful and happy, and all that, but it never seems to happen. So my latest

approach is just avoid the situation entirely. Because they're protesting at the University

of Texas, in Austin, where I am, I thought about going down there, but it doesn't seem

like it would be much use. I did that cardboard thing for so long, which is all protesting,

you know. I was protesting my name getting dragged through the mud by crime. Crime that

I didn't commit, so you know, I had to protest to prove that I was innocent of any criminal

wrongdoing, and that was my way of doing it. But it runs on a completely different

system from the way these people are protesting. It's more politically motivated, mine is more

prove my innocence motivated. So I never seem to sync up with those quite as well. There

hasn't been one that I really wanted to get involved with. Black Lives Matter, I showed

up for Black Lives Matter in Washington, D.C., right in front of the White House. That was

the only one I actually physically showed up for. I thought, you know, the whole equal

rights for all, you know, usually show up when there's some sort of racial injustice

going on. But these conflicts all over the world, you know, because I'm from Nevada,

there's a little bit of isolationism, where just stay out of it is what I like. And the

Russia-Ukraine, Israel-Palestine, you know, just stay out of it. I wish, you know, when

the United States formed, we were an isolationist country, meaning we stayed out of foreign

affairs as much as possible. And I always liked that. I don't know when it started that

we had to get involved in every conflict. I know we're probably not involved in every

conflict, but we sure are involved in quite a few of them. I still prefer staying out

of it. I live my life staying out of it. You know, if it's a conflict that's too big, I

just walk away from the thing and avoid the area it took place in. That brings up this

whole animal thing where, you know, where are fights prone to occur and how to avoid

where those spots are. And like, how interaction occurs in the same area or the same situation

occurs over and over again, and how to either prevent or avoid that situation from occurring.

That would be a way to reduce conflict if it was possible to predict when that's happening.

And that's like chasing storms, you know. If you're trying to predict the weather at

that point of when aggression or conflicts are going to occur, judging by how people

are acting, how everything is interacting and what causes the situation to escalate.

So I spend a lot of time thinking about that, too. I don't know. I'm going to stick to telling

my life story on here and explaining my plight. Anyway, stay tuned.

So I saw the aurora was going on way farther south than usual and uh when I was up in Alaska

um when I was leaving well I saw the aurora all winter because it was really easy to see it there

it would just cover the whole sky but the most memorable time I saw it was uh it was the it was

like mid-December and I had to drive back to Las Vegas because my dad had just passed away

and I had to uh square everything away so it was mid-December in a blizzard

I was in a Toyota Tacoma 4x4. I put everything in the truck and then drove uh up to Fairbanks

I was in Wasilla. I drove up to Fairbanks and spent the night in that mountain range that's

just south of Fairbanks and uh this is when you know I think it was dark most of the time at this

point um and so it was like 20 below and I ended up resting sort of sleeping in my truck on the

side of the road and uh that aurora was so bright and uh and beautiful that uh it was the most

memorable because I remember seeing it over the mountains and it was all green everywhere

so that was a pretty uh hairy trip back I uh had to uh I I had to ask for help on the alcan

because I was gonna take the Alaska marine ferry and then I had a big dog with me I had a

carillion bear dog which is an aggressive breed of dog and then I got unnerved about taking the

Alaska marine ferry because I thought you know having this aggressive dog with me I might as

well drive so I I turned back around in Skagway and then went along the alcan back this was during

the blizzard and uh ended up sliding off the road because I hit the snow bank on the shoulder

and it pulled my two tires off the uh off the road and then just pulled me into the

the side ditch that was the only time I went off the road in in recent memory um and it was it was

a good amount of snow that Tacoma you know I almost pulled right through because I went

into the shoulder a little bit and then like tried to keep my momentum up and uh uh tried to like

go way off and then steer back on the road to to pull myself up the embankment and that Tacoma

almost made it you know I didn't have snow tires on it I had those BF Goodrich

all-terrain KOs uh and they were just kind of trail off-road tires and I did have chains for

the truck but I didn't end up putting the chains on uh so I I had only been stuck there for 20

minutes and a guy from Wyoming pulled up and uh just towed me right out you know my two tires were

my front two tires were almost back on the road at that point and that truck was the most

unbelievable um off-road vehicle I only got stuck that one time but its traction it had a rear

locking differential and uh and was just extremely good at maintaining traction in low traction

situations so I did uh I did end up getting pulled out that one time I might have been able to get

out on my own uh give it more time because I could have put the chains on it I could have put

the floor mats on the uh under the tires and I don't know gravel I might have had uh I think

kitty litter you put kitty litter on the snow or something and it melts it or helps you get

traction um I can't remember what I had with me but I might have been able to pull myself out on

my own it was a really uh daring blizzard um I did make it back I stayed at the uh

it wasn't

I can't remember the name of the hotel it's at Lake Louise it's a really nice Lake Louise Canada

um it's a really nice uh like five-star resort I stayed there one night but it was a really

memorable one night um because uh because it was the middle of the winter uh Lake Louise was frozen

but you could still see the mountains behind it it had its its pizzazz to it so I was uh

I was pretty impressed by by Lake Louise Canada um and then I ended up just driving back the

rest of the way and and that was the end of the uh the uh adventure because then I had to

go through the difficult process of of putting my dad's estate together and proving any any uh

crimes were false so it was a long ordeal anyway stay tuned

Austin has been such a helpful city that I don't know if I ever even want to leave

for anything. So we'll see. You know, it would be nice to clean up the last of my parents' mess.

Part of, you know, more is digging up from it. They got married in Reno somewhere,

and my grandfather was CEO of a tool company. I think the entire tool company just dumped

when they got married because they were way out in rural Nevada. So I think, you know,

he was CEO, and it would have gone to my mother, but she was way out on a ranch.

So the whole thing kind of dumped into Southern California and was purchased by another

larger defense contractor conglomerate. So I don't know what happened with it. My last

name is Haas, and in Ventura, I think Ventura, California, there's a company called Haas

Automation that makes CNC grinders, and my grandfather's tool company also made CNC grinders.

So there's a pretty good-sized coincidence there, but I don't know if it's even worth trying

to dig this thing out. The only thing that caught my interest with Haas Automation

is they have a Formula One team and their NASCAR team. You know, both their racing

divisions, both Stuart Haas Racing and Haas F1 Racing were interesting,

but, and Circuit of the Americas is here, so that would be a racetrack,

but it once again looks like it would just have me bouncing around everywhere.

Even, you know, even if it's for a job, you know, I'm still bouncing around, which I get so tired

of. I like being in one spot, then one vacation, and then back to that one spot again. So, and

those, those race teams, they, all they do is travel. As far as the CNC grinders,

my grandfather's were these analog, you know, you had to manually turn the wheels on them

to get them to grind like camshafts and whatever cylindrical thing you needed grinded,

uh, but, uh, the new Haas Automation ones, they're all, uh, electronic, so you, you push the numbers

on the screen and it does it all. I don't know if there is any way they're related to each other,

because my parents got married when, uh, uh, when Haas Automation became a thing.

If somehow they used, I don't know, you know, some kind of casino lock to block

the rest of the world, and then the whole thing dumped in Southern California, and

other people named Haas picked up the, uh, the intellectual property involving, uh,

this CNC grinder company and made Haas Automation out of it, because I've never met any of them

before, it's just coincidentally the same name and same, uh, product, you know, they are producing

the exact same, uh, uh, tooling equipment, um, just updated to modern times, uh, so I don't know

how that happened, or if I should even open the door. I've made little comments on the Haas F1

race team's Instagram page, but it's just light-hearted, uh, banter, uh, and it's not a

company I want to disrupt either, you know, uh, it looks like they're doing a pretty good job the way

they have it, and when I get to that gear, you know, we could just renegotiate whatever's wrong,

if anything, uh, because Southern California has always been pretty good about

handling business correctly, from what I've seen at least, and, um, all that I can see that would

come from it is I would just end up working for them, and then working for one of the race teams

and having to bounce around again, uh, so, uh, I don't know. I was also thinking, because they do

Haas NASCAR and Haas F1, uh, a Haas MotoGP team sure would be interesting. I would, uh, I was

into MotoGP for quite a while. Uh, they could just take over with the Haas name,

and, or I could learn some cues from them and, uh, start my own Haas branch,

because at one point I ran a company called Haas Tech, which, uh, uh, was just an IT consulting,

you know, uh, uh, repair servers and workstations and do remote service and stuff like that, so,

it was a completely different industry, and, uh, uh, I didn't even know Haas Automation existed

at the time, and if this thing had some weird, uh, connection to itself, because, uh, I was kind

of dumped into this whole situation blind, and no one's talking, you know, I'm the only talker, so

everything I know is already on here, um, so, I don't know what to do.

Uh, I'm just walking around aimlessly now. Anyway, stay tuned.

So I've been watching clips on TikTok of that Met Gala and the huge fiasco that's going on

regarding blocking celebrities and that woman's reference to the Queen of France that

that neglected or chose to not feed the peasants and instead

ended up getting herself executed because there was a revolution to overthrow the regime

that was oppressing the population and that somehow is similar to the Met Gala.

I don't know how I feel about all of it. People are really swept up in

what's going on in Gaza and Palestine and Israel

and I was thinking, you know, if you're really trying to help out

the quote-unquote peasants, I don't like using that word, the lower middle, you know, the lower

class, middle class, because all these people sit at the upper level, you know, if you want to help

out the lower class just go to any street corner that has a guy standing with a sheet of cardboard

on it and give him 5, 10, 20 bucks. That's the way to avert that. There's a guy standing right

there that could use a donation. I mean, I'm sitting right now on, I think I have $14 or $16

in cash, $5 in my PayPal and $5 in my Cash App, which I am very thankful for the donations I've

received and they mostly go to Taco Bell, which is, you know, I have a thing for that Mountain Dew

Baja Blast and I'll get a few tacos and it just tastes as good as could be, so thank you again for

the donations. But going back to the Met Gala and the division between rich and poor and the best

place to make donations, you know, I'm still sticking with cardboard. Even if I make it big,

you know, it's going to cardboard again. You know, if I somehow make a bunch of money and

need to make donations, I'll just donate to whoever's standing on the side of the road with

a sheet of cardboard. It is a full proof system. It's been running for, I don't know, since the

dawn of human history, I think someone has been sitting outside with a sign explaining

their situation. So you can see there's like three or four standing out there now.

As far as foreign politics, I know this gets into foreign politics because

we just isolate ourselves from the rest of the world. If everyone in the United States

is just donating to the people with cardboard, then there's no assistance being, no support

being given to third world countries that are in need. And I understand that, but it sure is,

you know, we could handle a lot of the division between rich and poor

completely in the United States without getting involved in foreign conflicts. So anyway, stay tuned.

So, I was thinking, you know, I could do news reports from the side of the road here and

tackle all the tough, tough issues like, I don't know, new graffiti over there and, let's

see, what else, what else is our top story for the morning?

There's traffic and cars rolling by. And it's sort of cold, but I don't know what the temperature is.

And the sun's up, but I have no idea what time it is.

I don't know which path to take this platform in.

Because I somehow got a pretty good following on here, I'm trying to make the most of it.

And doing TikTok news would be interesting.

It's difficult, you know, like finding actual news reports and, you know, actually being able to have interesting footage to put with it.

Because I'm just using a cell phone with a little light attached to it.

I don't have much as far as camera gear.

So, my Zoom is impossible. Like, there is no Zoom.

It is just what you see is what I got.

I have multiple paths to be able to take.

One, you know, I saw there were a few news reporters on TikTok already that seemed to be doing a pretty good job.

And this brand, you know, there's other brands I could go to.

But this thing is so much fun.

Like, I just like sitting on TikTok and watching random clips.

Which is what started this whole thing, you know.

I was just sitting around watching random clips and enjoying it.

You know, there's so many other websites you can go to and so many other things you can do online.

But TikTok, I think, is the most entertaining.

I'm a little upset about how they keep trying to shut it down.

I remember the first time, five years ago or something, the federal government tried to shut down TikTok and have Oracle buy them out.

And Oracle is this company in Northern California.

The only link I had with them way back when is my mom.

Well, I know my mom works for the Calneva, which was a casino on the Nevada-California border in Lake Tahoe.

And Oracle, that company, bought out the Calneva and owns the Calneva.

So it was the same company that owned the Calneva that was trying to buy TikTok.

So that started my interest in the brand in the first place.

And because the kind of casino, lounge act, nightclub party is very similar to just watching videos on TikTok.

You know, you got the same people in there.

It's the same music.

So they're very similar to each other.

And that's why I was able to transition over to TikTok pretty easily.

Now, I'm going through the latest buyout where that Shark Tank guy is trying to buy out TikTok.

And I think it's just going to go through the same cycle again where they're going to try to close it down.

It's going to fail.

Someone's going to come along and try to buy it.

That's going to fail.

And it's just going to reset again.

So I don't know how many times it's going to go through that cycle.

But it sure is a fun, entertaining brand.

I went on Instagram and YouTube shorts, and they just don't have the same, like, punch to them that TikTok has.

So I'm going to turn it off.

So I'm pretty happy with my time investment in this thing.

And hope it continues to be a success.

Anyway, stay tuned.

So I'm stuck on the I-35 and Anderson intersection in Austin and I don't have a bus ticket. I don't

have a car. I can only go as far as my legs will walk. And these boots, you know, I'm wearing

these hiking boots and they're not the best for walking. So my ability to travel is very

local. It's not the worst place in the world, you know. I like to make the most out of whatever

situation I'm in. And it's a pretty busy intersection because I'm almost out of money

again. I'm just ready to go back, stand out there and say I'm out of a job.

I barely last night got my sleep cycle closer to being asleep at night and awake during the day.

I'm really trying to get that thing to set correctly. I was in a completely backwards

gear. So it's difficult to get it to reset to awake during the day and asleep at night.

And I don't know how I got myself that rehearse. But it was it was bad. I could

have been born in it for all I know. My parents were not were not in the best area when I was born.

So I don't know what they did. But I'm at the corner of I-35 and Anderson. It's a

interesting enough spot. There's a guy washing windows and then that other spot's empty.

The problem I'm having is I've stood at that other spot before.

And, you know, the second you start standing out there, someone else shows up and wants the spot.

But if there's no one standing there, then no one shows up. And I've gotten in yelling matches

before over that spot. And I don't need to yell anymore. I've yelled so much in my life that

I'm having to yell about another thing. I might as well just sit here and watch the world go by.

I keep hoping this this TikTok business venture will turn into something.

But it hasn't happened yet. You know, I'm still stuck in the same spot I was when I started.

I do you know, I get a clean shave now and a shower and a bed. Whereas before

before I started uploading to TikTok, I was sleeping in a tent in a sleeping bag in Florida

and just begging on the side of the road on the spots on my list.

I don't know what my best options are. I'm going to keep hustling around online.

I'm about, you know, I'm tempted to just turn into a spam bot and just hustle every possible

brand I can get any help out of. I've been trying to tell my story on here for a while.

And as you can see by all the videos, you know, everything I've ever been through is on here.

And hopefully someone's learning from it. I wish I could package it in a better way that

was a little more sellable, you know, so I could actually earn a living.

But so far, I haven't been able to. I did write 61 pages in Google documents, but that somehow

mysteriously disappeared. And I've been having trouble with the Wi-Fi at that hotel. I had people

connecting to my screen so they could see what was on my screen. And I don't know if they could

get into my shared documents or not. I just have to shut down the computer now. I was able to keep

a PDF of the documents, so I still have a PDF version of it, but the original Google documents

disappeared entirely. And I don't know, you know, another thing about Google is their backup.

Because I upload so many videos on here, their backup system, you know, you'll get to 15 gigs

and then it won't let you back up anymore. So I went through and deleted everything in the

in the Google backup to clear space for more videos. I don't know if the documents were

included in that. It sure seems like pointless to have a backup if the second the thing goes full

you click delete on it. And then there's no, you know, you delete your main document too. You know,

what's the point of the whole thing? So I liked it better when you opened up a word processor

and click save and it's saved on the computer. And then you save to an off-site backup system.

The way this one works, you know, it doesn't save to the computer at all. It's all in the backup.

So there is no, there is no backup then. There's only one save. I wish I didn't lose that. I think

I still have most of it because I emailed them around a few times. But that was an irritation

to say the least. I'm probably going to keep walking around. It's so nice and sunny here

that it's a nice day to be outside. Anyway, stay tuned.

So, uh, I'm trying to correct too many bad habits at once.

I was trying to reset my sleep cycle to sleep at night and be awake during the day

and completely quit smoking. I just switched to Nicorag gum and vape and no cigarettes whatsoever

and I shrunk down the vape way down to mostly Nicorag gum.

I also switched, I was drinking those flavored drinks, they're just, you buy the juice powder

and then put it in a pitcher and have one. It was making my teeth too yellow so I stopped

drinking them and now I'm just getting too frustrated with the world for it to work.

So I have to keep walking around outside to cool off.

It's difficult, you know, there were a few bad habits in there and I'm trying to get them out

and, uh, you know, just switching to drinking water instead of those, uh, those flavored juice

powder things, um, really made a big difference. You know, I just, I feel better, I like it better

because I was going through pitcher after pitcher of those, uh, of those, uh, flavored packets

because they cost like a dollar and you put them in water and then you have that much juice.

And, uh, you know, it's a dollar for like six, two liters worth or something, um, which is a lot of

juice to drink. Um, and I was just gorging on them, uh, you know, all the time I'd have one

of those drinks in there. So that was the big one, you know, and I don't know what,

what caused it, it's just having a flavored drink was, was nice. Um, I switched that to water and

that was a, uh, a big transition, you know, for something so small that didn't seem like that big

of a deal. Um, I switched that and, uh, and the Nicorette gum, you know, I switched to Nicorette

gum over vaping cigarettes, still vaping a little, but I haven't had a cigarette in like a week now.

Um, so that's good. I still kind of sense the thing going off, but I'll just drink a lot of water

and that seems to help quite a bit. Um, and the big, big factor is Nicorette gum. Um,

it's probably not, not helping me sleep at night because, uh, uh, you know, Nicorette, it's,

it's all nicotine too. So, uh, uh, you know, that's not helping with my sleep cycle, but

hopefully I'll be able to wean off the nicotine entirely and be able to sleep at night. Uh, so

I'm sitting out in the same spot I was before watching the festivities. Um,

there's, uh, not a lot going on in my little spot, but, uh, uh, I can't really do much.

You know, I think when my, uh, face clears, cause I'm down the last few little bumps,

um, these were scents that were all squeezed in like over 20 years out of a habit. I would

just squeeze it over and over again. And, uh, and I never like really put much thought into it

until they started like blowing back out. And, and that's what caused years of me having my face

torn up is all the, uh, acne I squeezed in for 20 years, uh, started just blowing back out. Um,

so I, I think I'm at almost the tail end of that, uh, which will be nice. Cause then I'll just look

normal and be normal, um, and be done with that whole backlog. Uh, but, uh, uh, I'm still looking

for content ideas and business ideas and, uh, ways to make money. Anyway, stay tuned.

So I've been going through providing for others and me personally not having anything to provide,

but what, you know, like sharing and what's important and all of that, you know.

Because I have very little, like a backpack, a laptop, this cell phone,

and a few sets of clothes, that's like everything I own.

There's not a lot that gets in the way. So, you know, it's kind of liberating

having very little possessions because I can just be free to take all sorts of different paths and

options. But as far as providing, you know, providing for others, then you need some of that

stuff to be able to provide. So I think me being undecisive is what's hindering getting to the next

step, which is being able to work with others, being able to provide to a woman, and

being able to be productive in society. So I'm going to keep walking around out here and

fishing up ideas. The only option I have is this, the walking back and forth

up there and saying I'm out of work. I don't have many opportunities opening up right now,

so I'm still trying on TikTok to see what I can dig up. I'm going through the whole

what to watch on here and what would constitute a rip-off. So like I'm being really careful what

videos I watch so I don't start influencing people and so people don't start influencing me.

Because on my end, you know, I always feel like I'm ripping someone off when I watch content and then

upload my own content because it'll come out similar and then I'll get really paranoid about

trying not to take from anyone. So that's what I'm going through now. Anyway, stay tuned!

So when I was in Florida, I got stranded because my van got towed and was stuck near the interstate.

I think it was interstate 95 in Titusville. So I was stuck there for a while. I ended up

getting enough money and in donations to buy a tent. I bought a tent and went like a mile or two

away from the interstate into like the forest lush swamp area and slept out there and then

would walk back and forth between that and the interstate and just cardboard on the side of the

road. But one time I got the bright idea that I wanted to go to the beach and it was like 20 miles

to the beach from where I was. So I had to lug my tent and sleeping bag all the way to Cocoa Beach

which was the best spot. I mean there were a few of them along there. Cocoa Beach was the one I was

usually at. So I lugged my tent, sleeping bag, backpack, all my clothes, enough food and water

to walk that far. I was mostly just eating ramen noodles which I'm still doing by the way. You know

I haven't traded ramen noodles. But I was mostly eating ramen noodles so they were really light

to carry. And I walked the 20 miles to the beach and put the tent on the beach and it was an experience.

I was staying there overnight but I had it really discreet. So I went you know a mile

or two away from where the main entranceway was. There were still people there during the day but

at night everyone would leave. So during the day I'd take the tent down so it was just the canopy

covering without the tent dome put up. So it just looked like one of those beach

sun shades. And then at night I'd pop up the tent and just sit out there and no one ever

bothered me. It was pretty interesting because people would fish right out in front. You get to

watch them haul in fish and get to look at all the beach crowd which you know wasn't bad.

You know this was central Florida so it wasn't you know it wasn't Miami level but it was still

a very nice place to be. I was hoping I was going to be able to get dug up there.

I tried at one point to work as a dishwasher at a restaurant and I lasted a couple days

but that cigarette curse was still on me and I was trying desperately to break it

but it was getting in the way of everything. So I finally had to give up plus I had to sleep in a car

and it wasn't the most comfortable place to sleep. I wasn't sure how safe it was going to be. It was

almost safer just sit on the side of the road and beg with a sheet of cardboard. So I ended up giving

up on that but I think that was in Vero Beach. The reason I was there is because my dad had this

Piper Pacer airplane for like 50 years and it was a piece of my childhood the whole way through.

I went to Vero Beach and walked by the airport and sure enough that was Piper's headquarters.

So I ended up hanging around there and then that's where I tried to get a job

and tried to get into a structure which you know I'm still having trouble with.

I think the whole thing just clicks over when it's ready to but it's been a process.

So I was out there for a while and ended up walking back. I did a lot of walking while I

was in Central Florida. I went all the way down. I think I went south of Vero Beach

and then all the way up to the Daytona Beach but I didn't carry that tent with me through all of

that. I just you know went to sleep at strip malls and wherever I could lay down. Sometimes just in

the jungle or forest or whatever you call Central Florida. I still haven't gotten a

firm definition on it. I don't think it's quite jungle and it's not quite forest. It's like in

the middle but I sure had a ball with that tent on the beach. If it were up to me, this is another

thing, if it were up to me in power I would have designated beaches that you could just sleep at

for two weeks. You know I'd have the net same national forest rules. You can sleep in the

forest for two weeks and then you have to move like a certain distance and then you can sleep

for two weeks again. I'd have designated beaches with that. I was going through the hospital system

because these big hospitals they're building they're costing billions of dollars that have

so much sterilization in them. It makes me wonder if having some exposure to nature

would create some health benefits over this over sterilization of how hospitals are operating.

So you know that would be part of my medical rehabilitation system is have

a designated areas where you could just sleep and take in nature a little bit and just clear

your head of all the stresses of society because that sure helped me. It got me out of the

whole bandwagon but I had more to say. I can't remember. Anyway stay tuned.

So I'm not sure how well the microphone is going to do with all this noise, but I decided to get a different angle on how I'm feeling myself.

It just rained really, really hard here.

And I was thinking about Florida and living in tents in Florida, and how interesting it was to go through a rainstorm in a tent.

I hadn't used tents since I was a little kid. You know, I know I'm kidding, because I was a toddler.

But when I got stranded in Florida, the tent was like my heartbeat.

And I would plow right through those tropical storms in the rain.

Now, the wind wouldn't seem to affect it much.

If you were laying inside the tent, the wind, you know, it would blow the tent kind of sideways.

You know, it would blow it over on its side a little bit, but it wouldn't move around a lot.

But going through the rain, you know, whenever it rained for three or four days, it was interesting, to say the least.

I mostly stayed dry. I'd use those raincoat carcasses.

And I would just kind of sit in the tent, trying not to move around too much.

And that would keep me out of the rain.

I stayed dry most of the time. I think I only got soaked and drenched like twice.

And that was when I was walking around. It wasn't a big deal.

But I was also going through the environment, and how much damage it does to the environment to have a person sitting out in a tent in the forest, jungle, lush, tropical area.

And as long as I didn't leave any trash behind while I was there, I would use those little leftover bags from Walmart and fill them up with my trash and then go throw it in the dumpster.

So there was no trash whatsoever.

The worst thing I did to the environment the entire time I was there was, I think, chopped a root one time.

And that was, you know, I felt bad about it afterwards. I was trying to get a flat camping spot.

And, you know, I had to rip up this root so I could have a nice, comfortable camping spot.

A nice flora.

Because you can get that really comfortable if you sculpted the dirt just right.

You can have a perfect, like, posture when you're camping.

So that was the worst thing I did was that one time.

And I felt bad about it, but, you know, it wasn't that much.

You know, considering what other people do, it wasn't that bad.

I would clear, you know, I'd have like a 10 foot by 10 foot square that was cleared.

And then put the tent up there.

As far as bringing the water and puddles when, you know, sometimes the puddles would get pretty close to where the tent was.

But they never actually got to the inside.

And it was an experience.

It would be one of those things, like, I would suggest that you can find a way to do that.

To spend, you know, two or three nights in a tent in a rainstorm.

In a lush, tropical area.

And just listen to all the critters running around outside.

And all the lightning and thunder.

And how different of an environment it is from a normal house.

That was one of my big events.

Anyways, stay tuned.

I've been looking at ways to

Promote this brand, you know, it's going pretty well. I'm working pretty hard on it

So it's doing its job, but because I'm using a $30 cell phone

The camera is not the best now because my face is all chewed up

Having a blurry camera isn't the worst thing in the world

I could you know, it's like 50 bucks for a

Better phone one with the three camera thing

And I don't know if it'd be worth it. This one's working pretty well

the other thing I was eyeing is a

Microphone, you know a cordless clip on my my sweatshirt microphone and

I'm hesitant on it, too

The only time I need is when I do those faraway clips

It is only so necessary. I mean, maybe I like yelling, you know, why do it this way?

I have to yell at the camera and

That kind of adds to the pizzazz of the thing I

I don't know what else I would need to

To increase the success of this channel

I I only have this little stand and a light for the cell phone and that's all I'm using

It's it's not a very

Expensive operation, but it sure is doing its job and

I'm more focused on learning how to

To put quality content up and having good stories and and

Good

Reputation with the thing. So anyway, stay tuned

So I'm standing out here and I got a another guy standing with a sheet of cardboard and I

asked him, you know, I can put you on this channel and you may get some more exposure.

We're at the corner of Anderson and the south

I-35 or I guess headed north I-35 ramp. But here he is, he's got his dog out here. I'll get a

little closer. This should help. So I'm trying to look after everyone out here and I wanted

to help out where I can. I don't have any money but I sure can do this. I'm going to keep trying

new clips. Do you want to talk? All right, all right man. So I'm going to keep trying to do that

and see who I can help out with all this following. I've been going around walking

around everywhere and met a lot of people. So trying to get to the next gear of this thing

which is helping out others and that seems like the first step to it. Anyway, stay tuned.

So, I've been trying to think of video ideas and I was going through, you know, like

dogs I used to have. I've had all sorts of dogs. I had a Samoyed, a Basenji,

a Carilion bear dog. My parents had German Shepherds. I did not like the German Shepherds.

The last time I was here in Austin, I went to the pound and got what I thought was a German

Shepherd. It turned out to be a wolf German Shepherd cross, so you had to feed it red meat

and it was really aggressive. I tried to return him to the pound multiple times

and failed. I tried to return him to the Albuquerque pound and failed. So, I finally had

to shoot the poor thing because he was turning into a road hazard on the interstate because he

was going to attack me in the back of the truck. So, I finally gave up. That's the only big thing

I've ever had to go through was that wolf German Shepherd cross and I thought he was a German

Shepherd when I adopted him and it turned out to be this wolf hybrid thing. Then, after that,

I went up to, I don't know if the pound is like doing that, like making you think it's a different

dog than what it is, but I went up to Idaho after that and or Spokane, Washington I should say,

and went to the pound there and got what I thought was a Border Collie. It turned out to

be a Carilion bear dog which is a completely different breed. It's kind of irritating,

you know, not knowing what dog you're getting and how it seems to switch after you get the thing

because that happened twice. Now, the Carilion bear dog wasn't bad after I figured out it was

a Carilion bear dog not a Border Collie. He wasn't bad. I had him for like five years and then

got a Siberian Husky and he had a puppy with the Siberian Husky. So, I had all three and then when

I went, you know, when I had to move, I had to give up on all three dogs. So, that was the last

of my dog ownership, but the one really bad one was that wolf hybrid. I will never have anything

to do with a wolf again. That was like my life was in danger being anywhere near the thing

and like trying to drive with it in the back of the truck and it weighed like,

and this was in the cab of the truck, and it weighed like 130 pounds. You know, it was all like

anger too. So, I could not, I couldn't get out of that situation. That was the worst one because

I kept calling the pound over and over again to try to return him and they kept saying,

oh, we have a three-week wait and then the Austin pound said, oh, we can't take dogs back

once you adopt them. So, that was the only large thing I've ever had to like shoot and

I think I was near Santa Fe, New Mexico. I was on my way back to Vegas and I thought he would fight

with my mom's dog and I kept trying to return him to the pound and it just wouldn't happen.

I felt more and more unsafe with him near me and then I thought, well, I'll just turn him

loose in New Mexico and he'll run around out there and while turning him loose, you know,

I was like, well, is he going to attack someone and then am I going to be liable if he attacks

someone? So, I finally got so wrapped up in this thing that I couldn't get out of. I had to

shoot the dog which was rough. You know, it's not something fun to do but going back, you know,

that whole German Shepherd thing, that starts when I was a kid. When I was born or shortly after I

was born, I think when I was born, my parents had two German Shepherds and then at the peak,

they had five German Shepherds and they were always these really obnoxiously aggressive dogs

and for a little kid, you know, I'm 42 now and I'm thinking, you know, for a little kid,

trying to raise a kid with four or five attack dogs that are completely wild, you know, I would

have done it differently. Anyway, so I won't get into it too much but that's what started the

German Shepherd thing. So, I was used to German Shepherds being there and I don't know if I felt

more comfortable having one around and that's why the second I came to Austin the first time,

I immediately went and adopted a dog but that wolf hybrid was the worst thing.

It was not a dog, it was a wolf. It was a looking, you know, just looking for an opportunity to

to attack and dogs operate differently. They're more, you know, trying to work together

with you whereas wolves are just trying to attack. So, I don't want anything to do with a wolf again.

As far as the Karelian Bear Dog fiasco, I thought he was a Border Collie when I adopted him.

I don't know how the look changes of the dog or how they even do that but

going from you thinking it's a Border Collie in the pound and then you take it home

and it turns out it's a much more aggressive animal is annoying. I wish they would

categorize them better when you're adopting them so you know what you're getting. I know the pound

will just play it off like I should have known that in the pound and not been confused about it

but it sure did look like it changed completely when I took him home.

I haven't had a dog in like five years now after the two Siberian Huskies and one

Karelian Bear Dog that kept tearing up the backyard so I had to give up and take him to

the pound. I took him to the pound in Idaho and gave up completely because I cannot stand

how many racists there are in Idaho. Everyone up there seems like they're either racist or no

racist and I can't stand it. I like all types of people. I can't think of a type of people I don't

like, unilaterally don't like. There may be a certain few in there from any race that I may

not like but the whole thing like across, no it doesn't exist. There's going to be at least one

person I like of any race, religion, nationality so because it's impossible you know there's going

to be someone you get along with of anything. So I left Idaho for that reason. I don't want

anything to do with it. What brought all this up is I was just watching the Mad Max Furioso

trailer. I think that's how you pronounce it. I was just watching the trailer of that and it just

dug all that back up. I had the same racist problem in Arizona. All sorts of racists out

there that I don't want anything to do with so that's why I live in Austin now and that's why

I'm like bounding myself to Central Texas, Southern California, and Central Florida

because I don't have to listen to any of that down in the southern part of the country.

I really, I haven't been there in a while. I haven't been out there in a while. I don't know

how bad it is. This is another thing, if it were me in power I would reduce racism considerably

with whatever means necessary to get this to stop because

when I was out there it was out of control. So anyway, stay tuned.

So, I've been listening to music all day and watching various TV, and I saw that Iranian

president's helicopter went missing. I remember, when I was in LA, I was homeless and wandering

around, and I saw on the front of a bus that Kobe, rest in peace Kobe, and I was like,

that can't mean Kobe Bryant. So, I went and asked someone, and sure enough, Kobe Bryant

died in a helicopter crash. They crashed into the mountains in inclement weather.

There was fog. They couldn't see what elevation they were at, and he crashed in the mountains.

That kind of sucks. It was a shame. They shouldn't have flown in inclement weather

because my dad was a bush pilot. You know, I grew up in Alaska partially,

and we were flying around everywhere in little bush plains, and we would never fly in rough

weather. It was just, just don't fly. So, this Iranian president, sure enough, they flew in

foggy conditions, and the helicopter went down. That is the, you know, I've seen this situation

happen so many times that, you know, there's nothing you can do about it because usually

they won't listen. You know, even if you tell them don't fly in inclement weather, don't fly

in low visibility, don't fly in, I'm ready to say don't fly at all because I don't want to be

anywhere near aviation again. But, you know, the people that are still flying, the best you can do

is don't fly in inclement weather. So, I feel sorry for them. You know, I don't know if this

is going to cause a regime change, but, you know, every time I see one of these helicopters or planes

or anything go down, you do a little investigation on it, and sure enough,

there was some pilot error involved. I'm telling this story after having a 32 ounce of

Miller High Life beer. So, if I'm a little slurry, just ignore. I'm walking to the

store to get a few more. I do enjoy beer. You know, things I enjoy, beer is one of those things.

So, anyway, stay tuned.

So I was reading the news and because my dad was in aviation and I was in IT,

you know, I still like look at the space industry, just kind of watching it do its thing.

And then I brought up Elon Musk and I thought he was down in Boca Chica,

but now there's some rumor they're staying in Austin. He has a house in Austin.

And I started looking, I'm like, I wonder where that house is, you know, he has a place in Austin.

And sure enough, I am 7.4 miles away from it. I could walk over there.

I'm not going to, you know, there's probably a better way to handle it. I just end up being

paparazzi walking over there. But, you know, 7.4 miles still is a little ways, you know, to walk,

but it's not nearly as far as I thought it would be. You know, I figured it would be farther away.

The funny part is, when I was in Las Vegas, I had a house with a pool and I would have these

huge parties at the place. I would get kegs, kegs of beer, and we would all play beer pong,

have all sorts of pool games going on, music playing, you know, it's the whole house party,

house party deal. And I was looking at the house they got there, and it's a house with a pool on a

lake. You know, someone was saying it's the most expensive house in Austin, but it doesn't look

like that much. You know, it's on 1.5 acres, and it's right up against the lake or river.

I don't know what could be made of it, as far as stuff to do,

because everyone's getting older. You know, I was in my 20s when I

was drinking in Vegas, and I'm 42 now, so it, you know, everything's kind of slowed down.

But having a keg at my house in Vegas really seemed to kick it over the edge. You know,

you get a keg there and suddenly everyone shows up, you know, everyone wants to be there.

And those things, they were like 80 bucks, and it would fill my house up every time. You know,

I tried to get people to chip in for beer, you know, and it would usually turn a profit,

you know, without even trying. I'd say, all right, this is 80 bucks, so everyone chip in 20.

It might have been more, maybe it was like 300 or something. But everyone chip in 20,

and that would pay for the keg, and we'd have so much beer to drink. So that was the most fun thing

to do as far as house parties are concerned. Now this thing, because this isn't Las Vegas,

Nevada, it's Austin, Texas, there's considerably more rules and regulations and restrictions

and noise violations and stuff like that. But that house, you know, it's like an attempt

at being a party house. It's just, it seems really far away from everything.

And even though I'm only eight miles away from it, but it seems really far away. Because in Vegas,

you know, the neighbors were right there. And they would have their own house parties. So we

would have these like competing house parties, who could who could have the bigger party at their

house, which added to the whole thing. It's pretty interesting if they're really at that house.

I use PayPal quite, quite often, you know, all the money I get from TikTok goes in my PayPal

account, which isn't very much, you know, I think I got $30 last month. But it all goes in my PayPal.

So I really like PayPal. And Elon's first, first business venture that I remember was PayPal. And

it was it's just always been good. You know, I wish it wasn't so big and such a monopoly.

It's got a little bit of a monopoly going to it. But it's always been good. You know,

I use my PayPal card now for everything. I have the cash app and the PayPal.

The only benefit, you know, cash app, it's like this small company that's just trying to stay

afloat. So I always like backing the small business, which cash app is. But both of them

are good. You know, I have both cards and they're both good. I don't know what they're doing with

their time these days. But having that house so close and me needing to make money, you know,

I was trying to figure out how do I earn a living? I could just go be paparazzi and just walk over

there and be paparazzi and and see if I get ratings that way. But I don't want to burn any

bridges either, which that that runs the risk of because I have a history in in I.T. and aviation.

My only real history in aviation is getting in a plane crash that my friend was flying.

But having a history in I.T. really, it kind of greases the wheels for me to like

get employed somewhere in their in their circle. So I don't want to burn any bridges

too soon, you know, just in case there's a job available down the road.

Me standing outside in front of his house recording it would ruin my chances with the job.

So I'm at a crossroads. I don't know what to do. I don't know if I'd even be able to hustle my way

in there if I tried there. There's other issues with it, too, because, OK, it's a house that's

really expensive. They have a really expensive house. I stay in a hotel that's really cheap.

Now, the house, it's really expensive. It's it's impossible to invite people over to one of those.

There's only like three people that can that can go over because you all have to be billionaires

or something. Whereas my cheap hotel, you know, as soon as I get my face to clear, I'm hoping to

get to a nicer one. And, you know, just a hotel with a pool. And then so now, you know, I'm

deciding, well, which one is better, having one of these mansions with a pool or staying at a hotel?

And the hotel with the pool seems to win every time because, you know, anyone can wander in there

and you just go drink and talk to each other. So I don't know if this this house is even worth

worth trying, you know, to get a party going. Whereas a hotel, you know, a party starts in

instantly. You have a bar right there. You have the pool right there and you have rooms to stay in.

So everyone has a place to stay. I don't know how how those mansions are supposed to work.

How it worked for me in Vegas is we all worked for Circuit City, which was this old electronics

retail giant that went under. And when it went under, you know, we would all just go drink at

each other's houses. So there would be like 50 Circuit City employees all looking for a place

to go party. And, you know, we'd cycle between each other's houses. You know, I would have one

and then one of my friends would have one at their house and then so on and so forth. And because

Vegas was such a party city, it was really easy to pull that off. That's why it was easy to have

parties at your house. Whereas Austin, you know, I don't know how many noise violations you could

possibly get. You try to pile 50 people in a house, whatever house it is, to get one of those

things going again. The only thing, you know, we would play video games all the time at one of

those. And it was a lot of fun having a lot of people over and then just playing Mortal Kombat

or something and seeing who the best best player was. That was a lot of fun in the Vegas days. I

don't know how much of that will carry over, but I may keep hustling around the Elon Musk empire

to see if I can get my foot in the door anywhere. It was pretty funny

to see that he is rumored to be located 7.4 miles from where I am, which I couldn't walk over. It

would take two and a half hours if I could walk over there. So anyway, stay tuned.

I'm still getting haunted by these politicians. So now I'm paranoid that

Hillary Clinton is threatening me somehow. I don't know what to do about it. I don't know what

situation my mom got herself into. She's from Washington, D.C.,

and I always get haunted by these damn politicians.

And the two major ones are Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton, and now Hillary Clinton.

And I don't even want to think about these people. I don't want to look at them. I don't

want to talk to them. But for some reason, I'm now haunted that Hillary Clinton is somehow

threatening my well-being. And that's a concern because I'm a little defense ball,

but I'm really talking it. So here I am talking. I tried to contact her department and figure out

what interaction they could have possibly had because they both went to college at Georgetown

and they're the exact same age as each other. So I don't know if my mom pissed her off and

then now she's after me because my mom pissed her off. And I don't really care. I don't care

if they're fighting with each other or me or someone else. What I do care about is when

a threat to my bodily—my person.

I'm not fighting with one person, I'm fighting with someone else. So,

continuing further on finances and why I have no money, or I think I have $30 total.

So, my mom has a really good system of, like, manipulating documents until everything's hers.

Uh, she did it to my grandfather. This all seems to be, you know, her and my, uh, my grandfather,

or her father, were very distant from each other when I was born. And then once I was born,

I think they wanted to meet me, and that helped them get closer. I don't know what happened

before I was born, uh, but she was very distant from her.

And he was, uh, he was CEO of this tool company and making a lot of money,

and she ran off to Lake Tahoe and worked as a card dealer. I don't know what happened

between them or what any of them did. I'm just trying to figure it out and get myself

out of very little income, which all of this still seems to be hanging over me.

So, he went to a retirement home. I was really young, but we spent some time together.

And, uh, I was trying to put the whole thing back together as a kid, you know, as kids do.

Uh, you, uh, you try to put your family together, so I was trying to put my grandparents with my

parents and get everyone to get along. Um, I don't know what happened with, uh,

all the money my grandfather made, but I, uh, I know, uh, that, uh, I was the reason he was around

in the later years. And she somehow manipulated all the documents, so all the money was hers.

And then my dad, he had some money when he passed away. Before he passed away, he got Alzheimer's,

and we went through the whole power of attorney thing. She pressed into me to co-sign on the power

of attorney. I caved on it and let her co-sign. She then signed all the, all his bank accounts

into her name and kept all the money. So that, that put a red flag on me because it's a simple

old con that I apparently fell for. Um, I didn't know this at the time, uh, that she was gonna turn

and sign all the accounts into her name. Uh, this, this then put a red flag on me because I was

somehow aiding and abetting her theft, but, uh, I had no way out of it. Uh, I did, uh, finally

press into her enough to, to find out, you know, she's just a woman that shows up at anyone's

front door with a gun and threatens them until they, they, uh, do what she says,

which is usually some kind of robbery. Um, that's what I went through. Um, uh, she, uh,

she now has all the money signed into her name. Um, I keep going, you know, I keep running out

of money over and over again. I can't do anything until all the assets she has acquired are accounted

for correctly, which hasn't happened. I have no way to do it. You know, how do I, where do I go?

Uh, who do I talk to? I'm sitting right here. There's no one, there's no way to cross that,

that boundary. Um, so I, I keep getting in fights in email with her, uh, trying to square away all

this money, who it belonged to originally, because I don't even know, you know, what

happened with her and my grandfather. Did he legitimately earn that money in the first place

or was that some rip off, uh, that no one knows about? Um, so there's no way to document any of

it. And, uh, I'm trying to stay completely on the law abiding side. So everything I do is

completely law abiding. Who knows what her side of anything is. Um, she tries to give these long

explanations as to why all this money is rightfully hers. Um, my dad's is the worst because she never

had a right to any of it. Uh, they had a, a prenuptial agreement that, that all their assets

stayed separate. And somehow, uh, she got around the prenuptial agreement and kept everything

from him. Uh, so I, I have to, you know, unravel this whole thing and, uh, uh,

try to get it squared away. Uh, anyway, stay tuned.

So I'm out walking around. I found this abandoned parking lot. I was trying to find a quiet place

to upload a video because everywhere is noisy with traffic and the microphone on this thing

is not the best. I started a PayPal fundraiser and I already got some donations in. Thank you

for the donations. I don't know how to transfer it to my straight PayPal account. It just stays in the

the fundraiser thing. So I don't know if that starts, you know, like if it all pools up and

then the end of the month it goes in my PayPal account. I haven't figured it out yet. I haven't

messed with PayPal that much to understand how it works. But because this is a donation-based

system that's all I'm using for income. And all I'm really buying is Taco Bell and Burger King and

vape and that's all. Once I get my face clear and my sleep cycle set and everything,

all the backlogs sorted, you know, I'll just find employment somewhere. I think the farthest I can

get right now is a bar or like restaurant as a dishwasher. I did IT for 15 years but it kept

burning me out. So I think I overworked myself and just overstressed and that's what caused the

burnout on it. I used a lot of alcohol, you know, I'd work all day and then drink all night. So

that didn't help. But I worked for a lot of retail companies. Fry's Electronics and Circuit City were

the two major ones. Now both of them have closed down. Fry's Electronics, I worked for them in like

2004. And then Circuit City 2008, right before Circuit City went under. But I think that was

all the electronics. Oh and I worked for Target for like a few months and then got fired

because I was leaning up against a desk or a table and I didn't even get a warning. I was just

sitting leaning up against the one of the counters and the boss came up and said you're out of here.

Like what? I didn't even get a warning on that one. That was the only time I've ever gotten fired

and it was without warning. So they may have been going through something else.

That was in Las Vegas and I was pretty well done with Las Vegas at that point.

And I like Walmart more. So if I had to pick retail stores, you know, I like Walmart more than

Target. Target always looks like it's about to go under. I don't know, maybe some locations are

more popular than others. But the ones I've seen, you know, they're really quiet and Walmart will

just be packed beyond belief. So I usually stick to the Walmart side of things. There's not a lot

going on to talk about, you know. I sat around and watched TV today and didn't do much. I'm out

looking for footage or something interesting to record and it's just not a lot. It's really quiet.

It's only cars going by and nothing else. I mean there's a few people walking around,

but I don't pester people that much unless it's some, unless there's a good reason to bother

someone. So I was going through the post office, you know, I walked over to the post office

and my mail, because I was homeless for so long, my mail jammed up somewhere and I never got the

stimulus checks or any of which should be thousands of dollars. I never received them. I set

up a forward to a PO box in Lake Havasu and never received the money. So I'm a little leery about

setting up another PO box because I never seem to get mail to it. I don't know where I'm gonna

end up landing. I may just stay here because I'm sitting in a weekly hotel room or monthly hotel

room. You know, I can go anywhere. It's gonna be anywhere I can make money is where I'm gonna be.

So once I get through whatever this is, you know, it's straight back to work and straight

back to making money. TikTok's going pretty well. You know, I have a pretty good following on here.

I don't know how to earn a living with it though other than PayPal fundraiser and cash app

donations. I'm gonna keep working at it. You know, I wish it made more

because it sure is a fun little gig. But maybe when I get a little more in, I can put

more money into this channel and get better content and that'll start earning a living.

Anyway, stay tuned.

So, I don't know if my parents started this, but I used to have a fascination with cheap land.

There's a lot in Texas. In Nevada, it's really cheap. You can get down to like $600 an acre,

so like really cheap dirt land. And in Texas, I know in between, I'm in Austin,

and in between Austin and Dallas, there's a whole large area of cheap land.

And it's always been interesting to me because it's really easy to put a house on it and then

just have a place to live. I've done it probably four or five times where you buy up a cheap place

and then fix it up, which is usually basic home renovation stuff. So, I've never done it with,

well, actually, I can't even say that. I've built a house on just completely a vacant lot.

It was just a double-wide trailer. And this is the house I ended up fighting with my mom over.

The problem with it was, it was so far away from anywhere, any civilization whatsoever.

There were no schools. There was no Walmart nearby. It was difficult to live out there.

That's part of the reason that motivated me to go to Texas, because there's schools nearby,

there's much more infrastructure, and it's more in, you know, with everyone,

rather than being outside and distant. So, that's why I moved to Texas. I haven't really

looked at cheap land out here to see what's available, but all I'm really looking for these

days is a house with some sort of town in a reasonable amount of distance. Both Alaska and

Nevada, you know, you could get a cheap house, like really cheap, but it would be so far away

from any sort of civilization, it wasn't worth it. You know, it wasn't worth being out there,

because you'd just end up sitting alone somewhere in some cabin or shanty or trailer

and with absolutely nothing to do. So, I had no one to talk to and no real way to communicate.

I'm still working on my communication skills with this thing. Alaska was the worst for it,

because you would be stuck in a cabin completely alone and completely snowed in

without anyone to hang out with or talk to or anything. So, I gave up on Alaska completely.

It's too far away. It's too much deserting, everyone. I like Texas more. It would take a lot.

See, these days, you know, I don't want to move around much at all. So, Texas, you know, I really

like it here in Texas. It has everything. You know, you got the coast to the south, so the Gulf

of Mexico to the south, and then all sorts of ranch land available. The only thing that's really

missing are the mountains. There were big, gigantic mountains in both Nevada and Alaska

and California, and those, you know, they were fun to see.

But Texas, you know, the more I get settled in here, the more comfortable I am.

So, if I could find a cheap lot of land here and had the money to buy it, I would probably

pick it right up, and that would be my base of operations. So, anyway, stay tuned.

When I was in Florida, I kind of learned that people liked hearing stories about Alaska.

Now, I didn't have many opportunities to talk to people, despite wanting to,

because I'm from such a different place to Florida. There's almost like a language barrier

there. You know, you speak the same language. You know, we both, we all speak English,

but there's like some inner grunt that's different, and I've been trying to figure

the thing out because it's kind of irritating. Because I'm from both Alaska and Nevada,

it's the complete opposite of everything Florida is. Nevada is completely barren of any life

whatsoever, and Alaska is really cold all winter. So, you know, there are some similarities between

Alaska and Florida in the summer. You'll see, you know, there's parts of Alaska that'll look

kind of Florida-y in the summer, but that only lasts like a month and then it goes back to winter.

But that brings me to my story. I was watching clips of that movie Roadhouse,

which is about this guy who works security for a bar and gets in a bunch of fights,

and that's pretty much the whole movie. But his name is Dalton in it, and I'm wondering if that

has, if his name Dalton is a reference to the Dalton Highway in Alaska, which I've driven.

I drove up to Dead Horse, Trudeau Bay, and I only successfully completed that once despite

making five attempts. I only pulled it off one time. The other four times, you know,

it failed for one reason or another. It is an extremely difficult road to conquer,

so, and the reason, the first time I tried it, I got there first first time.

I had just driven the entire Alcan, so all the way up from

Lake Havasu City, I drove 95 the whole way north, all the way up the,

through the lower 48, through Canada on the Alcan, and then up to Fairbanks, and I was so in the zone

that I decided, well, maybe I can make it to Dead Horse, and I did. You know, I successfully

completed that trip first time, and then I was like, well, maybe I can do it again, and you know,

I don't know if I got scared or lost my nerve or, you know, I was having financial issues too,

so that wasn't helping, but you know, the second, third, fourth, fifth time,

you know, I didn't make it, and the last time I tried, my truck got a flat tire, and

I was so close to out of money, I had to give up entirely,

and then my truck got towed, and they gave me an airplane ticket to fly back,

so I had to just give up on the stage at that point, and it was a pretty tough situation to

get through, because I was gonna sell the truck, and then fly back, and the only thing they would

offer is an airplane ticket for the truck, so, so, you know, I got, I spent $10,000 on that truck,

and got a $300 airplane ticket out of it. It's another one of those situations, I don't know

how I got into it. The whole reason I drove up there in the first place is my dad was a bush

pilot, and there was probably some investigation involving him. I don't know who was questioning it,

or how to, to resolve any of these investigations. I think it's because he was flying a little bush

plane across the Canadian border, and then into Alaska, so across Canada, into Alaska. I don't

know if he was notifying border patrol every time he flew over. It, it's another one of those things,

you know, maybe they spotted the plane, and started an investigation 50 years ago, and never

resolved the thing. The whole thing landed on me. I'm still getting through all these investigations,

but that was one of them, so that thing, like, hooked me into Alaska, and I ended up driving

around in circles until I ran out of money, and because I had no place to park the truck, you know,

it was the, it was, it was bad. I was asking everyone for help along the way, but anyway,

I did conquer the Dalton one time while I was there, and ended up flying back to LA, and that's

when I started becoming homeless, but watching this movie Roadhouse, and having his name Dalton

in the movie, really makes me think they might be referencing the Dalton Highway in Alaska,

because to Florida, you know, anyone who's been to Alaska is like this wild thing that,

that, you know, has to, has to be worth some kind of accomplishment, and I've been all the way from the

Florida Keys, the Key West, I've been from Key West all the way to Prudhoe Bay, Alaska,

just from driving, without using a headlight. So, the only, the only stipulation there is,

when I did the Dalton Highway trip, I ran out of money, and then had to fly back, and lost the truck.

That's happened to me twice, actually. I bought a van, and then ended up just, like, driving around

in circles over and over again. These were both Fords, by the way. I don't know if that Ford has

something to do with it. I may never buy a Ford again, but, you know, both, both Fords I had,

anytime I buy a Ford, I just end up driving around in circles until I go bankrupt, so I don't know

what that's about. But yeah, I bought a van, too, drove around in circles until I went bankrupt,

and that got towed, too. So, and that was in Florida. But that's the last of my Dalton Highway

experience. Anyways, stay tuned.

While being on the street in Florida I got really fine-tuned about what the weather was going to be

and because you know you get stuck in one thunderstorm you're then soaked for hours.

So I started to learn to like kind of predict when rainstorms were going to occur and

how to avoid them. I got a little tablet and I put all sorts of weather apps on it

and that's how I avoided most of the rainstorms was just keeping an eye on the weather.

I'm keeping that going. There was a giant windstorm last night to where the building was

vibrating here and it was at like 2 a.m. They said it was 50-55 mile an hour winds.

I looked outside. I don't think it got quite that hard but there was really

bad wind and it got me paranoid about tornadoes. I found this website called Tornado Maps

and it gives where tornadoes are touching down in Texas and the nearest one I could find

is this one in Colorado and there's one in New Mexico but in Austin it's just you know

there's wind advisories and this is about what it was last night. The weather report I've been using

is this. This is put out by the government. I don't know what it's called.

NOAA I think but this is the best weather report to get up-to-date information on wind speeds.

Now when the problem with this thing was when it was 55 mile an hour wind supposedly

this thing said it was 10 mile an hour wind outside and the building was vibrating

so I don't know if they didn't update it correctly. It works for when it's going to rain

but that's about as far as it gets. I'm learning about tornadoes because I'm not from here.

I don't know much about tornadoes and what creates them and how to avoid them because I got a little

spooked last night by the wind. I started looking up what to do in the event of a tornado

and it looks like in the type of building I'm in now is just go to a stairwell and sit under

the stairs and wait for the thing to blow over and don't go near any windows and stuff like that.

I've never even seen a tornado. It looks pretty intimidating by what I've seen on TV

and in the news. I've been through tropical storms that are very close to hurricanes.

I don't think I've ever been actually through a hurricane but I don't know for sure

because half the time I didn't have a weather report when I was in Florida and there were

big storms blowing over and some of the winds, trees were falling over in some of the wind I was

in when I was out in the brush so it could have been just the bottom end of hurricane level winds.

It was pretty interesting to say the least. Another life experience that I would encourage

people to learn about, maybe not experience because my biggest concern the entire time was a

tree falling down on me so I had to position everything so tree limbs wouldn't fall directly

where I was. I had one gigantic tree fall over in Florida while I was out in the brush and you

could hear that thing crashing down like no other so it looked like it would have hurt really bad

if I was underneath it in any way. That was the big and lightning you know I had a little bit of

issue with lightning when I was trying to walk around. I tried to stay near any tall

structures or underneath canopies during the lightning but there was a lot of lightning and

during the storms at night in a tent you would just see the whole you know the whole tent would

light up bright as day and then flash dark again and your eyes would take a while to readjust

so you'd go through like this flash and it was impossible sleep and then the crashing thunder

because I was going directly through these tropical storms in a tent which was exciting

to say the least. You know if you're depressed or anxious or have any issues with that

just go get a tent and go sleep out in the jungle and try to get through a tropical storm and you'll

forget whatever's bothering you because there is so much chaos going on around you that you just

you don't think about it. Anyway, stay tuned!

I'm out of money once again. I think I got 25-30 bucks in and I bought a couple meals of Taco Bell

and two beers. The beers were good. I've always liked beer. That's been my only real

enjoyable thing. You know, like once a week or once a month even I'll get some beer. So

I got two beers and a few Taco Bell meals. But I'm out of money again so I don't know how to turn a

better profit. I'm still trying to get through all this baggage. I saw the Trump verdict on TV

and how he was apparently guilty of 34 felony counts. I don't know if my mom ever had any

involvement with him. I have said before that she on her birth certificate it says she's from

Washington D.C. and I think she told me one time she went to Georgetown University which is in

Washington D.C. and dropped out after a few years and then left the east coast and moved to Lake

Tahoe, Nevada of all places. And that's where Trump met Stormy Daniels. So I don't know if

there's any connection there. There's quite a few, you know, she spent a lot of time in Washington

D.C. They're the same age as each other and she also coincidentally moved to Lake Tahoe and lived

in Lake Tahoe for quite a while working as a blackjack card dealer. She worked for the Calamiva.

I don't know if that has any significance in this whole thing. But it's fun watching it unfold.

The only other president I can think of that went down this hard was Richard Nixon and my mom

used to tell me stories about Nixon and the Watergate scandal. I think I wasn't even born

when that happened. But that was the last time a president really went down. This one, you know,

falsifying business records. When I was in Nevada, my dad was living at that cattle ranch we had

and all of a sudden one day I got a phone call or email or maybe they contacted my mom. I don't know.

But he was driving on the wrong side of I-80, which is the interstate going through Winnemucca.

And we moved him down to Vegas to a retirement home, Alzheimer's care facility and everything.

I don't know what hit him so hard. When I got up there, there's something really fishy about that

ranch. When I got up there, someone had already signed their name on the deed to the property.

They followed him around. They were helping maintain the road. It was a few guys helping

maintain the road so he could drive out to the place because it was way up in the mountains,

really difficult to reach. You had to clear the road over and over again because it would flash

flood. It was a couple guys that would do that to get the road clear. Then they started to want to

buy the property. They would follow him around and eventually they did get him to sign the deed

over to them for $140,000 or something. It was based on a payment plan. This all happened

all at once. He sold the property. I don't know if he was forced to sell. That's what it looks

like it's really close to. He was forced to sell the property and then almost immediately he was

seen driving on the wrong side of the interstate. I don't know if he had issues before that.

He had one little car accident where his car stalled out on the road and someone rear-ended

him while he was sitting there. That ranch sale, it didn't go through a realtor. They signed the

title over directly. If you lean on one of those places enough, you can get the owner to sell.

By leaning, I mean you just put pressure on the property owner until they feel so uncomfortable

being there that they sign the title over just to protect their own safety. That would be a forced

to sell situation. I don't know if there's a criminal charge there or if it involves Washington

D.C. in any way. It's still kind of fishy that that place got sold. This all happened when I was

working too hard in Vegas running an IT business. I never got a say in the property sale. I never

got to do an appraisal or clean the place up to see what it could be. I got blindsided by it

getting sold because I was the sole beneficiary to the house. All of a sudden one day, they said,

well, he sold the house. He was driving on the wrong side of the interstate and we had to take

him to the hospital. I don't know what happened there. If it involves Washington D.C. and the

Republican Party and all of the cronies that are there, because it's now proven that Donald Trump

had connections in Lake Tahoe because he had some sort of affair with Stormy Daniels in Lake Tahoe,

that's yet another connection to this whole thing. I'm not in a position to investigate, but

it's an interesting situation. It's that force to sell. You can press on any property out there

and just kind of squeeze out the homeowner and then buy the property. It looks like theft to me,

but I don't know. Anyway, stay tuned.

So I'm without money once again. I spent my last four dollars on ramen noodles,

and I think I still have like three of them left. And I have a few beers left,

so my diet is entirely beer and ramen noodles. I just walked into that bush. So it's pretty

frustrating how things are developing. My mom is sitting on three million dollars.

She had a prenuptial agreement with my dad. She has now changed her story and said there was

no prenuptial agreement. She forced him to voluntarily sign a will that signed everything

into her name. I have no money whatsoever, and her sitting on all that money that there's no way,

you know, she didn't earn it. We'll put it that way. She didn't earn the money she's sitting on.

And refuses to admit that. So me trying to work a job or do anything

with her sitting on three million dollars that was probably stolen

is difficult because I have to prove, you know, if I work a job, is she gonna pull off some

paperwork scam that then steals all the money I'm working for at a job? So that's what's causing my

hold up. It's incredibly frustrating. I have to walk it out again because anytime I try to

reason with her or negotiate, it, you know, it doesn't go anywhere. And she's got some long

story that doesn't make any sense. I see why she was out in the middle of central Nevada all by

herself in the first place. She's from Washington, D.C. She must have pissed off all the politicians

on top of me and everyone else she's ever known. So I'm just walking it out. Anyway, stay tuned.

So I'm still completely out of money. I'm looking at places where I could get a job.

It's pretty difficult because my face is still torn up with acne.

I drink beer and I'm still vaping but I'm not on anything

illegal. Completely clean. I have been for an extremely long time.

This is where I was eyeing. This BD Riley's. I could be a dishwasher or a barback or something

like that there. But once again I can't get hired until my face clears and it hasn't happened yet.

You know it's still torn up. So this would probably be my first choice of places to work.

The other issue I'm having is transportation. The bus is unreliable. Maybe I can't do it

correctly but I've been having issues with the bus. So they changed the bus stop. For instance

they have now changed the bus stop to this park to considerably farther away than it was before.

And it doesn't look like they're bringing the old one back. So that makes the transportation time

even longer than it was. And that's if the bus is even there. You know working at a bar would be

working nights and it would be difficult to catch the night buses correctly because I have never

gotten them to work right. I don't know if I should just walk in there. I wish my face would

clear up. Then you know I should be able to just start asking around. Because I worked in tech for

so long and IT and aviation. I was really eyeing that Starship. Their SpaceX Starship. That last

launch was so successful that it's going to draw so much attention from all over the world.

The first two or first three you know were kind of so-so. You didn't know if they're if

if the kinks were going to get worked out. But they really nailed it on that one. I gotta

I gotta give them applause. Just seeing it I just watched on the computer and

and just seeing it on there was one of the most incredible feats of engineering I've ever seen.

So for a rocket that big you know it's bigger than the Saturn V was. And they're just throwing

it together. You know this isn't NASA with government funding and all of that. Even though

I guess they do have government funding now. But this isn't the big government operation it was

during the Apollo era. It's just a a very good at what they do company building rockets.

So the only thing I'm trying to avoid is everything always seems to steer into

going to the moon. And I don't I went through this whole six month long process about

how you know anything that lands on the moon disrupts everything on earth. So you know

it's going to sound kind of hippie but you know you're you're shifting the gravity of how the two

balance each other. So I would if it were up to me and you know I'll do my best but

avoiding the moon entirely is is my my plan if I ever get into space anything.

Mars seems okay. I sure would sure would be like to be part of a Mars project. I was watching the

rovers like 10 15 years ago when they launched Curiosity and Pathfinder and Perseverance.

And that was that was impressive. If they could get Starship up to there that would that would

actually advance the human race considerably. So anyway stay tuned.

So I'm at, uh, I think, I think it's a farmer's market. I don't know. I haven't been here before.

I'm at Mueller Lake Park and, uh, there's a bunch of people milling around. It's Sunday, midday,

so, uh, everyone's got their little vendor tents out and, uh, not paying around. So,

I don't know. It's just a place where people are. I, uh, I was sitting around by the park

and, uh, trying to figure out what to do, what content to make, and what good footage there

could be. It's a warm day. I am completely out of food, so I, uh, I am stuck, uh, uh,

straining without food and, uh, have no money, but I still, uh, still hooked the parts so I can,

I can mill around these areas and not, not, uh, not, not have anyone know how completely broke I

am. Um, I, uh, I don't know what this thing is. I'm pretty sure it's a farmer's market.

It, uh, they have all sorts of booths and vendors. It looks like a nice one. I,

I try to go to these when I find them. Um, someday, you know, if I get through all my

parents' baggage, uh, having one of these booths at one of these things would be a lot of fun.

Just once a week, you know, getting, uh, having some sort of all-natural food product to sell,

uh, and, uh, uh, make a few extra bucks on it. I can keep walking around here and see if there's

any, uh, anything I can record. I mean, they got everything. They got a DJ. So,

it's pretty difficult to see from this angle.

I've got DJing on.

There the whole thing is. This is a really nice spot.

Uh, I've, uh, I've been all over the country. I've been to farmer's markets all over the country,

and Austin is either really close to my favorite or is my favorite. Um, uh, you know,

Beverly Hills was a close second. I went to the farmer's market in Beverly Hills,

and that was a really nice one, too. But because Austin has Starship now, uh, and that rocket is

doing such a good job for itself, it's kind of putting Austin on the map all by itself.

You know, the city was really good, and now with that gigantic rocket going up every couple months,

uh, it just makes it all the better. So, I really like it in Austin. Uh,

I hope to gain some traction and, uh, and find a, uh, find a good niche for myself.

Anyway, stay tuned.

Thank you for the donations. I bought food and beer with it. Both good choices in my opinion.

I'm still out of money. I can't do anything until my face stops blowing up everywhere.

I'm still waking up at 2 a.m. every night. I'll go to sleep at a normal time like 9 or 10.

Then wake up at 2 for absolutely no reason and with no way to go back to sleep.

Then my sleep cycle gets all weird and it's throwing off everything.

I don't know what's causing it. I'm trying to get it to set correctly. It hasn't happened yet.

Once I get those night jitters out, I'll be able to be more productive.

Right now I'm just out walking a little bit.

I was going to take the bus to the park but it's like $1.25 or something every time I use the bus.

So I feel like I need a good reason to go down there. Like some sort of event or something to record.

Just going down there for no reason is a waste of my little bit of credit remaining on the bus pass.

So I'm stuck just around the apartment walking around in circles.

There's worse places to be. This is a really nice town.

I don't mind being here one bit. I'm still looking at what...

Once I get my sleep cycle clear and my face to stop blowing up everywhere, what jobs to work.

Because I did IT for so long, I don't know what the industry even looks like now.

I may just try to be a dishwasher or barback or any of the hotel amenity jobs.

They're really easy so I don't have to work myself too hard like I did the first time.

It was making a lot of money before but I think I was working too hard and that's what caused everything to collapse.

So downtown, you know, there's a lot of hotels with pools and bars and all sorts of fun to be had.

So I may check into those. I can't believe how successful Starship was in its last launch.

I know there's a few bars around where the launch pad is and I could be a barback or dishwasher at one of them.

I'd get to be at least close to the scene, close to that thing going up, which would be fun.

So anyway, stay tuned.

So as far as my face goes, I've been taking about four showers a day and using that Neutrogena

face wash and just scrubbing my face with a sponge four times a day trying to get to clear.

Doing that every day for the past six months to no avail. Every time

I get everything to heal up, those big like welts under the skin form and I think it's from

just squeezing zits for too long. You know, I probably just didn't even think about it

and tried to pop them all for like 20 years and that all caught up all at once because I was

trying to, you know, just like I guess while playing video games, just not thinking and I

would just sit there and squeeze them over and over again. And that's what got them so ingrained

in my face that when I stopped doing that, they all started blistering back out really big.

So initially they itched really bad and I scratched them all out and then I'm still going

through that. And if once I get them all clear, you know, I'll just be a normal person but it

hasn't happened yet. And I still have bumps forming like all along my cheek or chin and

on my neck and my back. So eventually I'll get rid of them all but it hasn't happened yet.

I'm taking as many showers as possible to scrub them out. So someday I'll have a clear face.

Anyway, stay tuned.

So I saw that Hollywood actress or actor, I don't know what the correct terminology is,

but anyway, Sydney Sweeney bought a house in the Florida Keys and it is a big house.

This is a, it was like 14 million dollars, 8,000 square feet. I saw her like six months ago or

whenever her big scandal was and saw she was from Spokane, Washington. I spent some time in Spokane,

I'm from northern Nevada, I spent some time in Spokane when I was leaving Las Vegas and just

trying to get out of the whole party, everything. I bought a 19-foot mallard travel trailer

and got a carillion bear dog, which is like a good size hunting dog, and a compound bow,

and solar panels and batteries for the trailer and went and parked the thing out in the mountains

in northern Idaho near a lake and I would go out and fish and cook the fish over the campfire.

It was a pretty fun summer. Anyway, going back to her house, because she's from Spokane, you know,

it reminds me of everything from Spokane and trying to do all that in the Florida

Keys is interesting. There's a lot more fish to catch for one thing, but the whole environment is

different. Because I drove down there one time, or a few times I should say, I felt really pinned

down by the environment because it was, it was so, you know, oppressive is how it felt.

Everything seemed so expensive and so, like, I didn't want to step on the wrong

spot and upset everyone. But they have those same solar-powered, wind-generated,

off-grid houses down in the Florida Keys. They're just out on highlands, which is the opposite, because

in Nevada, you know, I was originally raised on a cattle ranch that was off-grid and just used

solar power and wind generation for power. And so the Florida Keys one, you know, you can see

the similarities between them. We had cattle at the one in northern Nevada, whereas the Florida

Keys, I think you just kept sharks to eat. I don't know how you make that self-sufficient.

I guess there's got to be food in the ocean to eat. But we were trying to make ours completely

self-sufficient, and we had cows, and then we would hunt deer in the winter in the mountains,

and then have the deer in the freezer. Like, one deer would last forever. Or one elk, maybe. I think

we'd get one elk sometimes. But trying to use that same mechanism in the Florida Keys would be

interesting, because they used the same solar-powered, wind-generated, off-grid housing-like

system. It's just surrounded by water. And another thing about my parents' house, my dad was a bush

pilot, so he would fly his little bush plane over the house and then land on an airstrip directly

behind it. I saw in the Florida Keys one, they had little helicopter pads, and they would fly

helicopters to and from the property. It was amazing how similar those two are. And, you know,

even more thinking about it, that ranch in Nevada, it's sold, you know, it's still kind of disputed,

but it's sold for $140,000. And that was on 160 acres with, you could run cows on the thing,

and you could, it had mineral rights, so you could you could mine the property if you wanted to. And

that was $140,000. And now for like an acre, a house on an island that's an acre, that's off-grid,

that's, it may not even be an acre, you know, it may be smaller than that, as a helicopter pad,

is roughly the same thing. It's like $16 million. So it's amazing the price difference between them.

When they both kind of serve the same purpose. Now, I don't know how pricing works,

but man, it got really expensive really quick down there. You can buy, even in Texas,

you can get junk land for like a thousand dollars an acre or something. So going all the way up

to $16 million for not even an acre, and for the same kind of off-grid house you're getting out

there, you know, that's a lot of work to make that kind of money. I have a lot of experience

in that situation, you know, maintaining batteries and how much solar power you're getting per day,

and all the calculations involved. And, you know, satellite airnet, satellite TV,

satellite phones, all that stuff, you know, I've dealt with before. But I am nowhere near the

income bracket of that thing. So all my skills go to waste because I could probably help out down

there. But I don't know how I'd get myself in the income bracket to even get near the thing.

I did drive out there a few times. I had a Ford E350 van, and I was sleeping in the back of the van

and driving just wherever I wanted to be. So I drove out to the Florida Keys and sort of got

in trouble for being there, but it wasn't that much, you know. I left as quick as I could.

I ran out of gas and money while I was there, and some nice people gave me a hamburger and a few

bucks for gas to get down the road and just requested I never try that again. I would have

to have a huge bankroll to even get into that situation. But, you know, I'm a licensed scuba

diver on top of that, so I have all these skills. I see why I was drawn out there in the first place.

Licensed scuba diver, strong swimmer, I don't have much boating experience, but

other than that, you know, off-grid, livestock, you know, the whole thing. So I keep getting, like,

drawn to the Florida Keys, but I should stay away because it's so expensive. So anyway, stay tuned.

Growing up we had a lot of off-road vehicles. Two Toyotas, a bunch of Subarus,

a Willys Jeep pickup and a Willys Jeep station wagon that were all four-wheel drive because we

had to go out to that cattle ranch and when we didn't use the plane you know you need a four-wheel

drive truck to get out there or car and so I grew up with four-wheel drive as like my my you know

everything had four-wheel drive in it. When I grew up you know I had even more. I had a Nissan Frontier

that had big tires and was four-wheel drive and a Chevrolet Silverado 2500 HD Duramax that was

four-wheel drive. Let's see a few other Subarus so I really grew up in the off-road scene

and I had a bunch of dirt bikes and motorcycles that would all go on trails and out into the

desert. This was all in the desert. Because I'm eyeing Florida you know some of that stuff gets

through the mud pretty well too. Those old Toyotas we had an 82 Toyota pickup and an 85 Toyota pickup

and the 82 was a short bed and had no extended cab so it was just the two seats and then a short

bed behind it. I put 31 inch tires on the thing and that was like a mountain goat. It weighed like

2,500 pounds and could go anywhere so I tried to fix that the best I could but

ended up selling it because it had you know it was carbureted and had issues with the carburetor.

I always enjoyed off-roading but what ended up causing problems with it is

you know I started researching the environment and everything to do with how to protect nature

and not destroy the desert and so you know off-roading all you were doing was destroying

nature and I got people yelling right here I don't know what they're doing yeah

and so anyway they are still yelling over there. I would turn the camera around but

yeah maybe I should just stay out of it. Anyway going back to the environment and four-wheel drive

and mud, that Toyota could probably get through the Florida mud pretty well because I was stranded

in Florida for like two years. I was always thinking about the best stuff to have over there

and jeeps are good but the new jeeps weigh like 4,000 pounds. That little Toyota is half the

weight and you can put the same tires on it and get locking differentials and all the

normal stuff for off-roading. So it would be exceptional in the mud or rough rough terrain

anywhere. It goes it goes through anything you know you can go through snow with it you put

mud or or dirt or steep hill climbs and they are still yelling over there. Anyway stay tuned!

I'm out of money once again, or I should say, you know, I have like five dollars in my PayPal and

like 75 cents in change. So no money whatsoever. And now I'm like trying to figure out the best way

to handle this. And I'm walking up and down where you would normally beg with cardboard. You know,

this is a popular cardboard begging spot. There's no traffic right now, so there's no one out here.

But I was wondering, you know, if I walk up and down the same spot while uploading a video

and ask politely online, will that cause, you know, will I get donations that way or more donations?

I'm still trying to find the best path to take to get through. My parents' crime,

you know, you can't even really prove it was crime, but there was such a long period without

anyone knowing what they were doing that it drove me bankrupt trying to explain it all.

And the biggest of all of it that I could find was my dad worked overseas and he was a

pilot in Africa and he married an English woman from the United Kingdom and they got a checking

account in the United Kingdom, in I think London, but I don't know for sure. So then he moved back

to the United States, divorced the woman, and the money stayed in London for like 50 years.

Then he married my mom and then they divorced and he passed away. So this whole thing dumped on me

and the money, because it was always in a foreign bank account, you know, it pinged some tax evasion

radar without actually quite being tax evasion. So when I tried to drag it straight over,

it caused all these problems. I got the exact taxes paid on it and was able to pull the money over

and you know, it was like $40,000. So I lasted like two years on it and then ran out.

But it was one of the many hurdles I had to get through that got me into this position

because I had to explain all this money that my parents had or made and without,

they had no paper trail on any of it. That was another big chunk of cash that had no paper trail.

So it, you know, I can't really prove that he worked in Africa to earn it all,

which makes it even more difficult. So anyway, stay tuned.

I've been watching the news a little bit and I saw, you know, Boeing sent up that spaceship Starliner.

It had been postponed multiple times and they had all sorts of helium leaks

and thruster issues before the launch and then they launched the thing and they had

even more thruster issues to where they couldn't dock with ISS because, you know, they weren't

sure if the thrusters were going to fire and align the spaceship with the International Space Station.

So they didn't want it to like collide and, you know, do damage to the International Space Station.

So they had to wait outside for a little bit of time before finally docking with

the International Space Station. That must have been really scary for the astronauts.

Now they've postponed when the astronauts are supposed to come back because they haven't

gotten these thrusters to work and this thing really looks like Apollo 13 at this point.

It was the failed mission that, you know, I can't remember. I think they blew an oxygen tank or

something in Apollo 13 and they had all sorts of problems and barely made it back and it was a huge

huge fiasco. Now the difference between them is I think Apollo 13 was televised all over the news

that they had a serious problem and, you know, we're wishing for our thoughts and

prayers up there. Well, you know, the Starliner one, if they can't get the thrusters working on that

capsule, it won't be able to realign itself to re-enter the Earth's atmosphere correctly and

it'll just spiral out of control and it won't have the heat shield facing down and that would

cause it to burn up in the atmosphere, killing the people on board. So that is a very

serious issue that's barely getting any news. They postponed it, you know, they were going to

re-enter four days later and I looked up the capsule. It can sit there for 45 days total

before having to return to Earth. I also looked up, you know, what other spaceships can they use

to dock with the ISS to bring them back and like Soyuz, the Russian rocket, I don't know

if Crew Dragon, you know, what their schedule is on it, but if that capsule really is

broken to the point where it can't safely re-enter Earth's atmosphere, they have to use a second one

which this is a really big blunder on Boeing's part, not having that thing work before shipping

it up. They had other issues, like I said before, they couldn't dock and they had thruster issues

and computer glitches. If it were me, you know, involved in it, I would be doing a lot more

launches before, you know, I would be doing a lot more dummy launches where it doesn't have

anything in it. You just kind of send it up there and make sure everything works and then let it

fall back and make sure everything works in that. In my opinion, they put astronauts in it too

quickly. So it's a shame because Boeing is such a big brand and that it has such a good name,

Boeing Starliner, it just has a really good name. But that is a dangerous situation to be in and

I really feel for those people now stranded on ISS with no way to get back. So I hope

they fix the issues wrong with it and everyone gets back safely. Anyway, stay tuned.

So I just got a new cell phone with a big old 50 megapixel camera.

How I got the money is I had unclaimed property in Nevada.

I filed for a a check from them like three months ago.

That thing finally came in. It was a good $492.

So I got a new cell phone and a hair trimmer

and that's why I got out of it. Now I'm deciding whether to just

use this as solely a camera because it's this TikTok page that's

making everything possible. I don't know. I may keep this as a

dedicated camera and keep my little $30 BlueView as cell phone.

It seems to work better if I keep the camera

separate from all the the cell phone applications and junk that gets piled on

there.

It keeps the videos clean and I can edit them more smoothly.

So I'm gonna keep messing around with it and see

see what works. Anyway, stay tuned.

So, I saw it was going to rain for the next couple days, especially along the coast.

And being from the desert, I enjoy the rain, even still, even now after living for years in

tropical areas. I think, you know, when I was a little kid, there would be one little rain cloud

and you'd always hope and hope and hope that it would turn into an actual rain, you know,

rain you would actually see on the ground, and it almost never would. So, you know, now living in

much more tropical areas, having it rain is still, you know, it's bringing up that old desert thing

where, you know, you get to see the rain a lot now. I don't particularly like being rained directly on,

but having the rain, you know, outside or having some shelter from it and watching it come down

is still entertaining for me. I wish I had transportation to get better footage of it.

Down the road, you know, once I get more income coming in, I'll keep working on this channel

and get better footage because this is another thing I would have gone to the coast for,

just to watch this tropical storm come in and all the theatrics involved with it.

But as for right now, I'm stuck in this one little spot, so I have to make do with what I got.

Anyway, stay tuned!

Now that I have this new camera, I'm trying to find different footage to take to really,

you know, see what its capabilities are. I went and walked out in the brush a little bit

and near this creek and I'm just looking for for things of interest. It really does

a considerably better job than that poor old Blueview 2 track phone. That track phone was

30 bucks and is the bottom of the barrel, you know, like phone. This one is a Motorola Moto G

stylus and it has a 50 megapixel camera and was 80 bucks. So a little bit more than that Blueview

2 but the camera is really showing well. I was going through the settings of it and it doesn't

have much as far as customizations go, like how you want the video to come out. But

it really is an absolute night and day difference between this one and the old phone. Even the

microphone is better, you know. I think it's more focused to where I'm pointing the phone

is where the microphone picks up. Whereas the Blueview, you know, it would just pick up

noise from everywhere and it would sound distorted and the video was blurry. So I am

incredibly impressed with this phone. I also put Call of Duty Mobile on it, which is a free,

you know, first person shooter, just fun game to play on a cell phone. And it runs incredible,

like just flawless. So for 80 bucks, you know, you can't beat it. Plus I'm still on

Tracfone's service plan. So this thing cost me $6 a month to maintain cell phone. Well,

maybe it's a little more, maybe it's $15. But that's, you know, I don't even use the data on it.

I use the very basic data just for the bus pass and, you know, once in a while I'll have to check

hours of a store or an address or something. Otherwise I use Wi-Fi for everything. So

data isn't really that big of an issue. And keeping that cheap of a service plan

really helps me not go bankrupt over and over again like I have in the past.

Speaking of the past, you know, I used to put tents hidden in spots like this

when I was in Florida. Like this brush right here, you know, you would make a little enclave,

I don't know what the word is, make a spot for yourself and then like cover it so no one could

see it. And you'd just have a hidden tent back there and sleep all night in the thing. It was

most exciting for the rainstorms. The rest, you know, you'd just be sitting there doing nothing

in the thing. But the rain was interesting to watch come down on a tent. I'm trying, you know,

as I keep climbing up and making more progress, you know, eventually I'll have a nine-to-five job

and just be a normal person in society. But I want to keep some of that,

you know, skill set going. So I'll probably still be doing outdoor adventure trips and

all sorts of video recording in the future. So anyway, stay tuned.

So I'm three beers in, or at least I think three beers. I've been playing Call of Duty Mobile all

night and just sipping beer and I was hoping to be able to fall asleep, you know, at normal

normal people hours, but it didn't happen. So I was laying in bed and I finally gave up and

it's been raining for like, it's been raining since noon, so I think it rained for like 12 hours.

So I've been stuck inside the whole time and decided to go walk and stretch my legs

and clear my head and just enjoy the just-after-it-rained smell.

There's no one outside right now, it's just me. I think there's one guy in a truck over there

and that's it. I just walked into the grass. That's three beers. Anyway, I'm going to walk

around a little tonight and see if there's anything, anything worth recording. I'm still

going through the new camera, you know, want to play with the new toy kind of

feeling. So I'm just walking around looking for stuff to record and trying to remember stories

to tell and all sorts of new things to do with this thing. I downloaded like five or six games

for it and they're all playing just fine. Call of Duty Mobile is by far the most entertaining one.

It has so many levels and so many upgrades and different player modes and it is an

incredibly good game. I think I had Call of Duty for like the Xbox or Xbox 360

when Call of Duty first became a thing and I had Counter-Strike in like 1997.

Half-Life was this first-person shooter game that everyone played, you know, it was game of the year

and won a bunch of awards. Well, there was a little modification made for it called Counter-Strike

and that was the first that I played of these kind of tactical shooters where you have two teams

going against each other. I am walking all over that place. Two teams going against each other

and, you know, you plant a bomb and the other team defuses it and stuff like that.

Counter-Strike was the first of that and it was just a little modification for Half-Life

that, you know, it was posted on Planet Half-Life which was the website at the time

and it's amazing how similar Call of Duty Mobile is now to Counter-Strike was 20 years ago.

So not much has changed except, you know, you don't need a big noisy computer to play the game

anymore. I used to have to overclock my computer and put a bunch of cooling fans on it and

everything just to play Counter-Strike whereas now this little cell phone does the whole thing

at higher resolution than Counter-Strike was. So, you know, technology has come a long ways.

It's pretty amazing how well that game plays whereas before, you know, you need a mouse and

keyboard and everyone would complain if you tried to use touch controls whereas

now, you know, on this cell phone playing Call of Duty Mobile it's just as fun as a mouse and

keyboard. So I don't feel like I'm losing any playing experience or any enjoyment

not having a mouse and keyboard to play it. So anyway, stay tuned!

So, finding different places to wander with this camera. And I found this old pathway that

is mostly overgrown and there's a bunch of graffiti along the wall. It's mildly entertaining.

Because I'm stuck on foot, I can only go, you know, what's within walking distance of my hotel room.

So, I decided to walk down here and see what it was about. This looks like it was an attempt

to be a little walkway to the pond, but it is completely overgrown

with all sorts of brush and I've never been down here before.

I probably wouldn't venture down here at night, but during the day it doesn't seem like much of an issue.

I don't know what it was supposed to be. See, they have all these concrete pads

for where people can walk to, but it hasn't been maintained in a long time.

There's another one down there. I'll go down to the pond and take a look.

You can see all the graffiti along the wall.

Here's a little concrete walkway and it's overgrown too. And this is the pond full of trash.

A pretty interesting little spot. It's so nice having this green everywhere.

I'm not used to it, you know, being from the extreme desert.

I partially grew up in Alaska and we spent the summers in Alaska.

Some parts of Alaska in the summer looks like Florida. It gets so green and lush up there.

The part we were in did not. It was just permafrost, pine trees and

kind of ho-hum foliage. In the summer, you know, it would it would green up a little bit,

but usually it was just permafrost, pine trees that wouldn't grow very much because it was so cold

that the ground would never thaw and they couldn't get their roots through the ground.

So the trees get stifled by the frozen ground and they grow really short.

You can see them all over the place. All these little short kind of dwarf pine trees.

What was funny was when I was down in Florida, there were pine trees there too.

So on the almost opposite side of the world were pine trees. They were in Alaska and Florida,

so that is a really, really hardy type of tree. The other thing I noticed, you know,

this was probably millions and millions of years ago, but at one point alligators lived in Alaska.

And so it must have been pretty warm up there at one point. Everyone talking about global warming,

you know, I started started researching it and it looks like the planets heated up

quite a few times before people existed. You know, there were these hot and cold cycles

and I don't know what causes it. You know, I was thinking about it and it's like a cascade of life.

You know, if, for instance, mammals, you know, this is real easy. If mammals keep reproducing,

while they keep pooping and keep producing methane gas or whatever carbon dioxide,

that creates greenhouse gases and heats up the planet. Without any cars or oil or anything,

the planet heats up just from having so many things

defecating everywhere. So I don't know if there's any way to even stop it.

I mean, you could stop all cars and everything to do with fossil fuels.

All the plants, animals, and people will just keep reproducing and the planet will keep heating up

until it gets into some like too hot to continue and then fall back into an ice age.

It's just a theory. I don't have any way to prove it, but it's something I gave some thought to.

Still walking down this path.

Never been down here before. It's pretty interesting to see where it goes.

More graffiti on the wall.

And they attempted to build a fence here at one point, but looks like it got torn down.

And this might be the other side of it.

There it is. I'm gonna go back down through this thing.

It's pretty amazing what's nearby. Just walking around, you know,

on foot I'm finding all sorts of fun little areas to explore.

the mosquitoes are, they might be mosquitoes. There's a bunch of little gnats flying around.

I got swarmed so bad in both Alaska and Florida by the mosquitoes. I was sleeping in my truck in

Alaska and in a tent in Florida and I would have to like hide in the tent from all the mosquitoes

in Florida and hide in the truck from all the mosquitoes in Alaska. So they are no fun.

You know, I didn't have any bug spray or anything, so I just have to like endure through it.

And it was a process getting the tent clean, clear of any mosquitoes every time.

Here's another little concrete structure. I guess it's a dam of some kind.

Yeah, they put some effort into this thing, I don't know, 30 years ago and just kind of

let it go. It's a really interesting path.

I don't even know what the name of this this pond or area is. It's kind of surrounded by

retail stores. So Goodwill's on one side and Walmart's on the other.

And it's starting to rain, so I'm gonna have to stop. But I'll walk down here and get one last

view of the pond and send it off. Anyway, stay tuned.

So I'm sitting outside waiting to get laundry done. I haven't done laundry in like a year.

I've been washing clothes in the sink the entire time and they don't get very clean that way.

So this should help getting the smell out. I went to the store and got food and an SD card

for this camera and that's all I've gotten. So I think I still have $300 left of that money.

So I'm trying to make it stick to the best of my ability but everything is a temptation.

Every little food item and little thing you want to buy just like jumps out at you.

So I'm sitting on it a little bit. We'll see how long it lasts. The laundry was five dollars.

You know it's going to start chipping away. I normally get a $30 food gift card but when I

have money that doesn't apply so you know all my food is going to come out of that money.

So it may not last very long. I'm trying to be as sensible with purchases as possible.

Because you know the cell phone it started when I was in Florida. I think I got a $100 donation

and I bought one of those on tablets and I was completely almost stranded on the side of the road

and I recorded myself with that on tablet and connected to the open wi-fi at one of the fast

food places and upload the video to TikTok from there and the whole thing like picked me up.

So I'm sticking to just recording what I'm going through and seeing what comes through.

I've been at it a while now a couple years but I have a strong background in IT.

I was a network administrator for a few golf courses in Las Vegas and also doctor's offices

and I was a field engineering

I think technician although it might have been it might have been one up from technician

for the VA hospitals. I don't know I did IT. I did Cisco work for

the Indian hospitals as well so a lot of hospital work.

So I've been doing networking computer networking since I was 15 years old.

That's why you know the second I had any money in whatsoever I immediately bought a tablet and

connected to the wi-fi to upload a video myself. It took forever to get that camera to turn around.

I could sit there and watch videos but I was either too embarrassed or just couldn't didn't

know what I was how to how to get through to actually record a video of myself and my face

has been chewed up for years so it was chewed up then too. I think that that embarrassment was in

the way and I finally just just stuck it through and started uploading videos uh telling my life

story and everything I've been through and that's what got me to the position I'm in now.

I'm still trying to climb up through it all you know I slept for six hours today my sleep cycle

gets really weird like I'll get really tired in early afternoon and sleep for uh you know a while

and then wake up and not be able to sleep at night and other days you know I'll get a normal night

sleep but uh we'll stay up all day and then still not be able to sleep at night and then the thing

goes wild again so uh I'm still trying to get it it dialed in um it uh it's been a problem since I

was a little kid I think you know when I started playing video games when I was like 15 16 I

started staying up later and later to play video games that might have been what initially threw

it off and I still haven't gotten it like reset correctly um I uh and then living in Vegas for

for 10 years didn't help because you know I'd worked those I.T. jobs but I was on call 24 7

so uh you know one of the clients would have to call me and then I'd either go out on site or

mowed in and fix whatever issue they had this awarded me a lot of uh leisure time to just go

party around the city and uh so that threw off my sleep cycle even more um I'm uh I'm trying to get

it to where uh it should be but but it hasn't happened yet as I'm I'm doing laundry at midnight

um because it's the only thing to do and my clothes desperately needed it so anyway stay tuned

Going out to get beer. And, uh, I've, uh, you know, during Vegas and, uh, even after in Alaska,

I've always enjoyed beer here and there. Uh, in Vegas, you know, I, uh, I was working that IT job

and, uh, just, just being a, uh, a, uh, I wanna say contractor, but it's not contractor. It's,

uh, uh, anyway, I can't think of the word. Um, I, uh, I got a taste for whiskey when I was there

and, uh, uh, whiskey was, was really good for a while, but it always seems to push it like too

far. Like, uh, uh, you know, you get a little too drunk, a little too wild on, on whiskey.

Um, whereas beer, you know, was much more, uh, subdued. So, uh, I haven't reopened the, uh,

the whiskey, uh, uh, desire. Um, all I would do in Vegas usually, uh, you know, we'd go out to the

strip and, and drink and I'd get the, like, some bars would have Dollar Jack and Cokes.

So I'd get those and, and like go to karaoke bars and stuff like that. Um, but at home,

you know, I would get those fifths of, of like Evan Williams or Jack Daniels and then just mix

them with diet caffeine free Coke and, uh, play video games all night. And that was like my

evening. Um, beer, you know, I don't think I drank as much beer in, uh, in Vegas except for,

uh, I had a house with a pool on a half acre and we would have parties and I would get a

cake for those parties. And then we would have like too much beer during that. Um,

but otherwise, you know, I wasn't drinking much beer, you know, uh, sitting at home.

It was mostly whiskey in those days. Uh, I don't know if I even want, uh, whiskey right now.

Um, beer, uh, beer is a really comfortable, uh, buzz. I, uh, I used to hang out with

some Native Americans and like one of my ex-girlfriends was partially Native American.

And she, uh, and anyway, uh, they would always refer to whiskey as fire water because it would

make them so wild and crazy, uh, that, uh, they, they steered away from it. And for me, you know,

I would get a little more wild, but it wouldn't go like over the top, like slamming stuff around and,

and, you know, getting, uh, overly aggressive. The natives are indigenous or, uh, uh, whatever the,

the common, uh, term for them was, um, would have more trouble with whiskey. And I still think

there's some spell attached to it that's doing that, uh, because it wouldn't, you know, I would

have fun with it, but it wouldn't go over the top of like, uh, losing self-control and going

completely wild. So, uh, I'm still a little perplexed by why Native Americans can't drink

whiskey or shouldn't drink whiskey or, or what started that whole thing in the first place.

It's got to be racism of some kind. So anyway, stay tuned.

So I've been watching various clips on here and going through my past and ways to make money and

my latest business venture is those little john boats or little row boats. I had one when I was

a kid. We would keep it in a trout pond. We had a trout pond at our ranch and it was full of

rainbow trout. We had a little row boat you could row out and like kind of see the pond and

and we rarely fished from it because the pond was so small that you could just fish from the shore

but it was fun to row around on. Anyway I've seen those boats on TikTok and they'll have like a

gigantic outboard motor on them and going like 70-80 miles an hour. So I thought that was pretty

funny and the boats they start out with you know are really cheap like $400 and one guy on here

said he he bought the boat for $400 and put a motor on it and fixed it all up and turned a

$1,200 profit on the sell just from flipping the little john boat. So those things make quite a bit

of money. I can tell by how efficient they are you know you are dealing with a light little boat

and in areas like Texas, Louisiana, Florida you know it's a really fun thing to have because

there's so many waterways you know you can you can just cruise around on that thing and have a ball

so I'm gonna keep looking around at them. The only two boats I've had were that little row boat

and a tri-hull in Vegas and the tri-hull was a you know five person actual boat but it

I never took it to the lake because I didn't trust it very much. This well I would have taken it to

Lake Mead and it I don't know how it would have gone it might have ended up being one of those

boats at the bottom of the lake. So I never took it out anywhere and the only other aquatics things

I've had are kayaks other than boat rentals jet ski rentals. I've rented house boats at Lake Powell

but the only two I've actually owned that would be considered boats are that little row boat and a

tri-hull and you know the row boat is roughly similar to a john boat it might have been a

little shorter than the ones I've seen on here but it could have used an outboard and had a ball.

The problem with it was there's like no water in Nevada so we only had that one little pond to put

it on and the pond was so small there was no reason to have an outboard of any kind on it.

Here in Texas you know there's so much water that having one of those boats would be a lot of fun

and I saw they had their little parties in the in the out in like the swampy river area

all with those little john boats which looked like a lot of fun. So also you know I saw that

hawk to a girl on here and I've been watching the updates on how many views the videos are getting

and I also just read that she lost her job from from posting that video or from being in that

video where in her case you know all she really did was gave an interview and you know maybe

answered the questions the interviewer gave. So losing your job over that and that's just a rumor

you know I don't have confirmation on it but losing your job over that seems pretty

pretty harsh. There's got to be some legal options there but it also got me thinking you know

how many jobs I'm no longer qualified for have her after having operated this TikTok channel

which it it seems absurd it seems like why no one can upload any videos in the first place

because you think you know someone's gonna fire you from some job or get upset or

or be angry with what you said on there. I'm sticking with you know just whatever I'm thinking

yelling it into this camera and seeing what comes from it. You know if you lose one job

you're just gonna end up being qualified for another so and it you know it it lets people

know like who you are and what you're up to and what your deal is so anyway stay tuned.

So, speaking of random no trespassing signs, I filmed a clip out here like yesterday and I

didn't see this no trespassing sign sitting out front. I walked, I can even show you the path I

walked, I walked along the sidewalk right there and then down here, and I've been coming out here

for months, I never saw that sign. Walked along the sidewalk, see this completely open sidewalk

down to the pond right there, and now this one no trespassing sign sitting over there,

you know, where is the no trespassing? Is it the entire pond or just that spot?

You know, it's really difficult to tell what they consider trespassing, and I'm trying

to not go past any trespassing signs, but how that sign was hidden there

is amazing, or how I couldn't see it, you know, I wasn't actively trying to

to go past a no trespassing sign, but see if you walk along the sidewalk right here

and down this path, you just end up at the pond. You don't even see that sign over there, and I

must have done that 50 times and not known that that's trespassing, because if it is even,

I don't know if you could prove that in court. See if I walk along the sidewalk right here

and walk straight back there, because of that sign way over there, I'm trespassing that, I guess.

I don't know for sure. See this whole thing, this whole strip goes down quite a ways,

and they just have that one little sign up at the front of it, that if you're walking

on the sidewalk here, you just walk right past the thing and don't even see it.

I am still going down how far this thing goes with, does this all classify as trespassing then

trespassing then from that one sign? Like where's the limit? Where's the line on

it's a public park? These are irritating little issues. I know it seems small,

but now because I've seen that sign, I can't go to this area I was going in before.

I'm assuming that that sign includes all the way to this wooden fence back here,

but it sure does shut off the pond from the sidewalk, and it seems like, you know,

now I'm like a mile from where that sign is, and it's still going in front of these apartments.

So I'm trying to walk to the end of it to see what it's limit is or where the end would be,

but you can't put a fence around it or something to keep guys like me from not knowing there's a

sign there. I know, see, it's one of these things where, you know, someone will keep the upper hand

on someone else, and, you know, I'll go, I'm staying in an apartment down the block from it,

and this is the nearest pond, so I walk down to this pond, but they keep the upper hand then

because they put one little no trespassing sign at the very beginning. Look at how far away

I've gotten from that thing. It's all the way back past the I-35 sign there, and

this, I guess, would also classify as trespassing, but it doesn't make any sense.

And now this is another one. See, these are the things that keep me up at night.

So this is an empty parking lot with a vacant building, and now they have a camera system up.

See, there's the camera, and then I have not passed any no trespassing signs or anything,

so I should be within my rights to walk along this area. It's just passing that fence

that would be trespassing and or, you know, because it says keep out, but it's just an

empty vacant building. But I should not be in any sort of restricted area walking along here.

It's really difficult to figure out. See, now the alarm's going off on that thing.

And I haven't walked by any signs or any obstructions whatsoever. It's just an open parking lot.

So, where the law stands on this is pretty difficult to determine. You know, you got

one no trespassing sign that's at the front of what appears to be a public park

without any other signs or anything. So, you know, I don't know where the law stands on this.

Available whatsoever. And then this one, you have an empty parking lot that's completely open,

but if you walk in off the sidewalk, you know, there's no signs or anything to say

you can't walk along here unless until you reach that fence. And so I should be within my rights

walking along here despite that security camera's alarm going off.

There's a million of these. When you're a pedestrian, there's a million of these little

things that is like impossible to know which direction you're supposed to go in.

And that park is the worst one because, you know, it looks like just an open park,

but then there's one little no trespassing sign at the front of it. So anyway, stay tuned.

So, walking around looking for content ideas, and I walked into this outdoor store because

all of my clips are like based around the outdoors or talking about the outdoors or

all the various camping experiences I've had. So, I walked into this outdoor store to see what

they had. I was mostly looking for waterproof cases for phones and maybe a camera stand and

microphone and all sorts of outdoor stuff. They had those little scooters, those electric scooters,

which I'm finding myself tempted by but kind of trying to avoid because they don't, you know,

I don't see many of them around. And if it worked, if those little electric scooters,

electric skateboards worked, you know, you'd see people riding them around all over the place.

Because everyone is so hung up in cars, it makes it difficult for any other vehicle to succeed

as I nearly get hit by one. It makes it difficult for any other vehicle to succeed

because the cars are so big and heavy that all the little electric vehicles can't really

function. And if you dedicate your own lane to those little electric scooters,

electric carts, electric skateboards, like one of these road lanes solely for

those vehicles, then it would probably succeed. But it'd be a hard push to pull that off.

So, I'm kind of, I put the electric skateboard, electric bicycle, electric scooter on the back

burner. There's just, you know, trying to ride it on the sidewalk, you know, pedestrians would get

upset with you. I do walk a pretty good distance, so it's not completely necessary,

although the range of my filming locations would go up considerably. I'd go from like,

you know, right now I'm walking like a mile, and that's my max range, to, I don't know,

five miles or something. I think those have a 10-mile round trip total range,

so I could go five miles out and five miles back. Whereas on foot, you know, I can go like one mile

out, one mile back. But I'm gonna keep walking around looking for content to create. It's so

warm that I'm eyeing these other hotels that have pools, and mine doesn't have a pool. I

just saw one over there with a pool out of the corner of my eye. A pool and a beer is like

the most tempting thing right now. So, anyway, stay tuned.

So I'm still walking around aimlessly, and I saw this church from the outside of my window.

So I decided to walk over here because you can almost see the light coming off of it,

the tower off that thing. And I walked over here because this is a much nicer church than the

one I was looking at. And I still haven't made it to an actual Sunday service. I've been reading

the Bible, and I made it, I don't know, 600 pages into the thing, and made it to like Xerxes,

you know, where Xerxes was building palaces and giving orders and all that stuff.

But I still haven't made it to an actual church. The next step I was going to take,

the next part I was going to read was that Imhotep, I can't remember his name, he was some

Egyptian architect and doctor, and he did a bunch of different jobs. But he was apparently the

architect that built the first pyramid, which was really interesting because I'm getting all swept

up in Mars. And looking at Mars, you know, you think Egypt, and you think if we were to build

a settlement on Mars, well, what kind of, you know, what kind of churches would you have

on Mars? Speaking of churches, what would you have there? And then I'm like, well,

Egypt is probably the most similar human civilization, because it was so far ahead of

itself, and got human development kind of rolling, because it was 5,000 years ago, I guess, way before

way before most of the other developed civilizations. So the first one to put on

Mars would be like the original. You would be building the original civilization for that

planet. And that's why I got swept up in Egypt. And I'm trying to put as much Bible into everything

I'm thinking about as possible, because it has worked for so long, and is so reliable,

that, you know, if you start thinking about space and rockets and human colonies on other planets,

it gets really unstable really quickly. Just look at those two stranded Boeing

astronauts who are stuck on the International Space Station, how quickly things can go wrong

for space travel. So I'm going to keep trying to, like, find the bridge between church and space,

because there's got to be a way to get them to both work together. And then you can have,

like, a conventional civilized town in space, or on Mars. So I'm going to keep working on old

west towns. Like, I'm from Nevada and Arizona, and all those old west kind of settlements,

you could drag the whole structure of that thing and just plop it on Mars and have a town there.

It would operate like old west, but probably still work. So anyway, stay tuned.

I got a screen protector three days ago, maybe not even that, maybe two days ago,

for this cell phone and it was like $15. I got the screen protector in the case.

Now the case is working great, but the screen protector is already starting to peel up.

So I don't know what's causing that. I had the girl in electronics at Walmart

put it on there and it lasted two days and already started to peel up.

So I'm a little upset about it. Because I have to hold this phone out in front of me on a

little stand, I always think it's going to fall. So I have a case and a screen protector on it,

so if it does fall, you know, it doesn't destroy itself. But having that screen protector go,

you know, I don't know if I should return it, exchange it, try to put one on myself and see

if that one sticks or just give up entirely. I was looking at my old cell phone screen,

which I've been using, you know, I've been using for a year and I haven't scratched the screen on

it. But I don't keep keys or change or anything in the pocket that my cell phone is in.

So that seems to help quite a bit. This one's considerably bigger and heavier.

So for the little stand, you know, it's a little more difficult for the stand to grip.

So I have to be more careful with it. Whereas the old one was really lightweight

and it didn't require as much as much care to record myself. But I've been going through Walmart's

selection. The only other thing I want for this cell phone is a microphone. I bought this stand

with a microphone and I could never get the microphone working. So I finally gave up and

threw out the microphone, which maybe I should have hung on to it. I have all my belongings set

so that, you know, everything I own, I can fit in two backpacks and just walk away if necessary.

So that makes it easy to move if I need to. Anyway, stay tuned.

Still stuck in some wedge my parents created. It's like 3.30 in the morning and I had like

three beers to try to fall asleep. It didn't work, so stuck awake and haunted by

Washington DC, Georgetown University, and my grandfather's tool company. So my grandfather

lived in Pennsylvania and this tool company was right next to Gettysburg, which is like

the Confederacy's headquarters, you know, from like the Civil War. So I see them all as racist.

They will contest that, but they look like racist to me. So I avoid them as much as possible. I

avoid that whole, I avoid Pennsylvania entirely. But my mom went to Georgetown University

and she dropped out after, I don't know, a year or two. The only story she ever really told me about

it was she was standing over a balcony and everyone thought she was going to jump off the balcony

so they either ran her out of town or she left on her own. And then the only update I have after

that is she went to Lake Tahoe and worked as a car dealer. And that was the end of Washington DC.

But the problem with her was, you know, when you say the White House,

there's two ways to take that, you know. With Pennsylvania and the Confederacy right there,

you know, you say the White House and the Confederacy would say, well, only white people

should be in the White House. And I don't know if there's some alarm you can trip in Washington DC

where it sets this standing over the balcony-like thing that runs you out of town.

But in my mom's case, she was in a really strange situation because she was born in Maryland

somewhere or DC or one of those two and then got adopted and grew up in Pennsylvania right next to

where the Confederacy was. So then when they put her back in DC, I don't know if she pinged some

radar as being racist when she didn't really have much say in it, you know. She may be guilty of a

lot of things, but I never saw her as actively trying to be racist. So she might be clear on that one.

I'm trying not to walk. But anyway, continuing further, because the same people are still in

power in Washington DC as were back then, you know. This was in, I think it was Nixon,

maybe shortly after. But it was, it was the Clintons, you know, I guess this would have been

Gerald Ford and then Jimmy Carter and I don't know what other presidents, like Radov, Ronald Reagan.

It's like the same circle of people still sitting in power over there because Hillary Clinton,

Joe Biden, Donald Trump, they have all been in there for 50 years. It's like the same circle.

So it's the same situation going off over and over again. And I am somehow haunted or

getting swept up in it or getting dragged into it because of my name's legacy that I don't really

have much to do with at this point. And I don't have an easy way out of it, you know. I can't,

I can't like back out of it easily because it wasn't anything I ever did, you know.

It was stuff my parents and grandparents did. So I'm gonna keep walking around until I get

tired and then maybe try to go to sleep again. Anyway, stay tuned.

I started thinking about the cheapest forms of transportation I could possibly have,

and like those electric skateboards, electric scooters, and electric bicycles are one thing,

and the other is going to a junkyard and getting like a salvage car and using it to get around.

The problem with all the electric vehicles or the little electric scooters and stuff

is roadway crossings like this. I mean, it's sort of a crosswalk, but it's not

really a crosswalk. So you can cross here, and a lot of pedestrians do,

but there's no way to really tell what the cars are going to do. Some turn, some don't turn,

some have their turn signals on and don't turn, and others don't have their turn signals on and

do turn. So you don't know what anyone's going to do. It's my only path to Walmart too, so

that's part of the motivation for this transportation thing. Anyway, regarding

pickup part, I've had a lot of cars over the years. Some were in pretty rough shape,

and I would keep them running with AutoZone parts and just kind of rigging them back

together until they ran. I did that for years, so I still have a lot of experience with

with cars that are not new. You know, some issues here and there and how to

keep them running for a long time. I've had a Toyota Koma with 220,000 miles on it

and 80s Toyotas with, I don't know, they were, you know, 160,000 to 180,000 miles, but really

rough, rough miles on them. I would keep them going pretty good. It's just changing fluids and

all the wearable parts, just swapping them out, so the thing keeps running. You can keep an engine

running a long time in an old vehicle if you just keep oil in it, and changes spark plugs and all

the basic stuff without overworking it, without, you know, over-exercising the engine. It'll last

a long time, like years and years and years and years. So this, you know, I don't know

what category that puts me in because, as you can tell, most of these cars are pretty new.

The cars people are rolling around in, at least from what I consider to be new cars.

A lot of mine were 80s and 90s, and I was driving them in late 2000s,

so, you know, 2008, 2009, 2010, so they were already 20, 30 years old by that point,

and they did fine. It was easy enough to keep them running. You know, there would always be

some little issue you just couldn't figure out that would be the most time-consuming,

and a lot of times there's a really cheap part to fix. Like, in one instance, I had a Toyota Tacoma

1982 Toyota pickup with a 22R motor in it, and it was carbureted, and it was one of those four-wheel

drive mountain goat pickup trucks, and I could not get the idle to work correctly. I tried

everything to get the idle working. I could not get it to idle smoothly, and what it turned out

to be is, in between the carburetor and the top of the engine, there was a seal that was supposed

to be there, or a gasket or something, and I didn't put that in, so that was letting air through in

between the carburetor and the engine, and that caused the idle to be off, and, you know, the

actual fix for it was like 30 cents or something. It was extremely cheap, but it took months and

months and months of trying to figure out what the issue was before finding it, so that's the

biggest difficulty with, kind of, junkyard rescue vehicles, is that one little thing that's wrong.

Trying to track it down is sometimes close to impossible. So, anyway, stay tuned.

I've been going through third-party camera apps on this thing, and this is all to try to resolve the focusing issue I've been having.

I think the stock camera, you know, it has all these AI filters and Google Lens, and I tried to disable them all, but it still seemed to have trouble focusing.

So I went through the Play Store and downloaded all the apps I could find that said camera on them, and went through them all one by one.

This is one of those aftermarket ones now that I'm trying this footage on, and we'll see how it goes.

I can use the TikTok one too, but you have to go through the app to use it, and I don't use cell phone data. I use Wi-Fi for data.

So I don't know if that thing's going to hiccup my little, like, small amount of cell phone data if I try to go through the TikTok app.

So I'm using this third-party one, and we'll see if it works or not.

It has some features that are better than the stock one, like a panoramic and, I don't know, slow motion or something.

But the stock camera app looked like it was smoother.

Like when I was recording, it looked like it provided smoother footage, but it just wouldn't stay in focus.

So I'm going to keep messing around with it.

Anyway, stay tuned.

Once again, slept for, I don't know, maybe three hours from like

nine to midnight or something, and then I've been stuck awake all night. It's like 5 a.m. now,

and just sat up, listened to music, played golf on the cell phone, and watched the news,

and I still haven't gotten these, whatever's waking me up in the middle of the night,

I haven't gotten it quite clear. So, you know, I just kind of have to wait it out.

When I walked downstairs, there was a huge swarm of people in the parking lot in the hotel,

and I don't know what's going on. I think it's just because I'm out, you know, later or earlier

depending on perspective, and that's why there's a bunch of people out there. But at first,

I thought there was some kind of party going on. It's a pretty quiet part of Austin.

There's not any bars or nightclubs or anything in this part. I'm in like,

I think it's almost North Austin, but I'm still in Austin, so I'd have to go downtown for the bar

scene, which I'm kind of trying to avoid because, you know, I can't sleep at night as it is,

and if I start going to those late-night bars, you know, I end up in the late-night bar

social circle, and then, you know, that just continues not being able to sleep at night.

Yeah, I still am looking for money and ways to earn a living, and a bar is a place I could work,

but I'd have to, like, move closer to where they are to be able to work there.

I don't know. That's about all I got. It's been a long, long night. Anyway, stay tuned.

So a few weeks ago I got $492 and I'm still sitting on $140, $150 of it.

Now most of it went into this cell phone and I'm going through its intermittent focus

and debating whether to try to exchange it for another one.

I had this problem with one of my little BlueView 2s. One would focus, the other wouldn't.

I don't know how many phones I'd have to go through to get the intermittent focus to resolve

itself. Because I got it mostly working with this third-party application, it seems to resolve the

the focusing issue, whereas the stock camera application doesn't.

So I don't know why it's doing that. It could be this thing is like Hubble Space Telescope, you

know. You send it up, it has its case, its screen protector, an SD card, and everything's working

great, and the camera starts going out of focus. So repairing it, repairing that focus problem,

is a huge process. So I don't know. I may just stick with it the way it is.

I got it going pretty good with this third-party application.

Despite the stuttering, everything seems to be working. I'm walking down

the sidewalk here just looking for footage of any kind to see what can be uploaded.

I'll probably be out all day doing this, and hopefully something interesting comes up.

Anyway, stay tuned!

The only place I could sit to, find to sit down is right here, and it's along the sidewalk. I

probably walked, I don't know, three quarters of a mile from the hotel, and I could sit down here,

watch the world go by. It's pretty difficult, you know. You'd think being outside you could

just sit down anywhere, but you know, there's very few places you can actually sit down comfortably

and be there for amount of time. I'm still hoping footage presents itself.

It kind of doesn't like jump out right in front of you, so you have to go walk around and

try to fish it out. I walked by what was once the site of a Home Depot. This is it behind me,

and when I first got here like two years ago, the building was still standing, but now they

tore it down. It's just a parking lot, so that was the last of that Home Depot. I'm wondering

how many of these retail stores are going to suffer the same fate. There's so much retail everywhere

that having stores closed is not surprising. Looking at career paths, you know, I did retail for years.

I worked retail and I worked IT, but hospitality is piquing my interest quite a bit,

mostly because, you know, you get a pool and a nice hotel room and you're close to work.

I don't know if they still do that living in the hotel room and work for the hotel you're

living in, but that was the old thing, I think. I'm looking for my favorite, you know, which would be

my favorite hotel to work for. I have some pool experience. In Las Vegas, I had a house on a half

acre with a pool, and the pool was just a concrete hole in the ground when I bought the place.

I had to plaster the bottom of it and then put that glue over it. There's this glue

paint you can put on it. I put that glue paint over the whole thing and I replaced the cartridge

filter with a sand one, and that might have been it, but it was an extensive process.

I think they told me it would cost you $20,000 to fix this pool. I did it for, I don't know,

$1,000, maybe $1,500, just using that latex paint and replacing my own sand filter.

It ran great for years and years. I probably got six years out of the thing before

selling the house, and those were a hard six years on the pool. We were having house parties all the

time, and it was a constant maintenance, keeping it clean and pretty with all those people jumping

at it. So I ended up selling that house, and I don't know if it was the right way or not because

I owned the house free and clear. I could have gotten into social welfare then and kept the house

and gotten into social welfare. Vegas was getting tough, and I thought,

well, if I sell it, I can move to a nicer city and not have to be in as much danger.

So I sold it and then slowly went bankrupt over the course of five years.

I lasted on that money for five years or maybe more, and then went bankrupt and the whole thing

caved in. That was all money I earned from IT in Vegas. I got a little bit in inheritance,

but I made quite a bit doing IT, and I was just putting it into that house.

Then I got laid off and used the money from the house to live off of.

So I would happily build another one of those ghetto fab single-family houses in Austin

because it was a lot of fun. When I bought the house, the ceiling was tearing down,

all the paint was yellow. I had to tear out the entire kitchen and put a new one in.

So it was a big process. I ended up making money on the house as a whole,

and it was a big party scene the entire time, which was part of its downfall.

So building one of those in Austin would be quite a bit of fun. I've never had a bank loan before

other than small little... I think I got like a $10,000

personal loan one time. I bought that thing cash, and I have no debt now, no credit card debt,

no bank debt, no mortgages, no student payments, no nothing.

So any money I work for and earn, I just have. It doesn't go to any debt whatsoever.

That's also why I was looking at the pick apart cars because I don't have to take out a loan with

one of them. I just make a few thousand dollars and buy the car outright and not have a payment

at all. That's what I did when I was earning a living, and it stayed afloat pretty well. It's

a lot of breath of fresh air with no debt whatsoever. So anyway, stay tuned.

Last night when I was trying to sleep my legs were twitching like crazy.

Like just weird flinches, you know, restless leg disorder. I don't know what you call it.

But, you know, I usually have to walk it out or like put myself in a different head space

to clear it, you know, to get the twitchy legs out of my system. The only other time I've ever

had that issue is I was down in Southern California and sleeping under a bridge near

Morongo Casino. I can't remember what else is there. There's outlet stores but my legs would

twitch like crazy under that bridge and it would just happen when I was sleeping under the bridge.

When I was sleeping anywhere else it'd be fine but sleeping under the bridge my legs would

twitch like crazy. So I finally had to move and give up at it and I came to the conclusion that,

oh, it's probably not where I should be sleeping anyway and it's something like

safety reflex going off. But having that going off in my hotel room, I don't know what to do,

you know. Like where do you go? That's where you're supposed to be.

So those are the only two places I've ever had that problem and I'm still trying to get to the

bottom of what caused it last night because, like I said, I slept for three hours and then woke up

and then had my legs twitching all over the place when I was trying to go back to sleep.

And this is in a paid-for hotel in Austin. So I'm gonna keep trying to figure that one out.

Anyway, stay tuned.

So I've been living here for about two years now and walking around, you know, when I first got

here it was really rough. I had to walk a lot more, mostly because I was just completely over-addicted

to cigarettes. I have since, you know, I haven't had a cigarette in a few weeks. I still vape a

little bit and I chew gum, you know, I got shrunk down to just chewing gum and that seems to help

quite a bit. Speaking of this vacant office building, I don't know what they intend to do

with it. It's been sitting exactly like this for two years, completely empty and completely lit up

and just looking pretty. I can't imagine what you can do with it. You know, who would need

an office like this? Like I said before, I used to run an IT consulting company

and one of its downfalls was I was operating the thing out of my house

and I didn't have any employees. It was just me working on call 24-7. But had I taken that

thing to the next level, it wouldn't have needed one of these office locations

and I never actually did. Now I'm looking at IT now and this stuff, you know, it should be getting

so repaired by this point that you can just keep it running for 30 years after one repair.

I don't know how much innovation is actually coming in. There's a lot of people kind of

stalling the market, meaning they'll only have fixed things to keep. I got out of it. I'm working

pretty hard on this content creation thing and there's other career paths I can take

that won't dry up on me like IT did. Anyway, stay tuned.

Here's yet another retail closure, or I don't know if you want to call it retail.

It was a standalone building that is now closing down,

but it was a Buffalo Wild Wings.

And because my face has been torn up the entire time,

I couldn't get in there until my face was clear of all acne.

So I've been sitting here for two years waiting for my face to clear.

And I was thinking, you know, the second I get it clear,

I'm going to go in that Buffalo Wild Wings. Well,

unfortunately that will now never happen because that Buffalo Wild Wings has

closed, which is a shame. I, uh,

I swear this has something to do with, uh,

trying to reduce the amount of traffic that's driving around because

these, these stores are closing down everywhere. Um, when this thing was open,

uh, I saw, you know,

it would only have people in the parking lot like Friday and Saturday night.

The rest of the week, you know, I think it was pretty empty. So it wasn't, you know,

it's not really the best location. Uh,

it's right off the interstate and, uh, you don't have like a,

a, uh, a nice road to it.

It would mostly cater to the hotels, which are right here. But, uh, yeah,

there's restaurants next door. So I guess this, uh,

this poor Buffalo Wild Wings met its, met its end.

Um, I had been going to these for years. Uh,

right when at least that I know Buffalo Wild Wings became a thing.

I started going into them and enjoying them. They were one of my favorite bars.

So I, I saw in the door, there's two other locations.

So it's not the end of Buffalo Wild Wings entirely, just this location.

But, uh, who knows how, uh, how many more retail,

locations are going to keep closing down because they, you know, everywhere,

you know, I'm watching these stores shut down. Anyways, stay tuned.

So I've been going through these presidents and one is now a convicted felon with 34 felonies

and the other is so old he barely knows like what's going on or what's happening.

I did some research on Kamala Harris who is the vice president and she's from Oakland,

California. I'm from Winnemucca, Nevada which is just across the the the border.

You know you shouldn't call it the border but the Nevada California thing I know they're still

fighting with each other out there. The people in Northern California fight with the people from

Northern Nevada. So I've been trying to smooth that thing over in any way possible and it's

it's been it has plagued my existence since I was a little kid that that no one in Nevada

likes anyone in California and vice versa and no one in California likes anyone in Nevada.

So her being from Oakland and the vice president you know it sure would be nice if that rivalry or

competition or conflict or whatever it is would smooth over. My mom's from as I've said before

my mom's from Washington D.C. and spent some time there as a child and I don't know probably

got herself in trouble. I'm trying to dig up the entire my entire legacy's past

and resolve any complaints, conflicts, criminal wrongdoings, anything that that occurred

that my parents did or grandparents did and that seems to involve Washington D.C.

All that I really get from it now is I get like too sucked into Washington D.C. politics

which I mostly try to avoid. I try to avoid you know now I'm at the point where I'm avoiding

Washington D.C. entirely. Before you know I used to go there once in a while when I had a car

like I went to the Black Lives Matter protest and when they changed the road to Black Lives

Matter Boulevard I was there for that. But watching the fiasco unravel between the two

presidents one being really old and the other being a convicted felon would that just make

Kamala Harris president by default. It said at one point she was she was president for like

two hours or something when Biden was in the hospital for some surgery. So she's been president

before and I sure have nothing against her. I don't have much knowledge of Oakland California

I've been there like once but the Oakland Raiders you know they moved them to the Las Vegas Raiders

so Las Vegas got a football team out of it and you know Oakland is another place I could probably

just park myself and be okay because it's not too expensive and I wouldn't have to worry about

people feeling too highly of themselves or looking down on me too much. Whereas the rest of San

Francisco you know it's a really ritzy expensive city but Oakland you only could park. I don't have

much intention of going over there. The big claim to fame on the town I'm from is if you drive

exactly one day from San Francisco you end up in in Winnemucca so it's exactly one day's driving

distance. So anyone in San Francisco and Oakland knows where Winnemucca is just because it's where you

stop to get gas. But I don't particularly want to be in Winnemucca again either. It's way out

of the middle of nowhere. The education system the reason I left in the first place when I was a

little kid is I was I was doing really well in music and the the music department out there

wasn't the best so I got moved down to Paradise Valley Arizona and and got to play in an actual

orchestra for school but that was before the whole IT thing. I hope this thing unravels peacefully

in Washington. It really seems like Donald Trump is he is an absolute felon at this point.

I don't see him as anything other than than a total criminal so I want nothing to do with him

and I wish Joe Biden was younger and you know I don't have much against Joe Biden other than he's

just old. So Kamala Harris is my presidential pick for for 2024. Anyway stay tuned.

The only place I can find to make money from the position I'm in, you know, it's just,

am I sitting here or am I sitting somewhere else, is on the corner of a busy intersection.

But as you can see, there's like 50 people out here right now. There's one guy selling water over

there, one guy sleeping, and more people selling water. And then there's a guy washing windows on

that corner, and a bunch of people selling flowers on the other side. And I don't know

if there's a better path to take. That's why I started this camera in the first place,

is because I was sitting on the side of the road using a sheet of cardboard as my only form of

income. And just waiting for work or an opportunity to present itself, which hasn't happened yet.

The only opportunity that did present itself was putting a camera in my face and

telling my life story. So that's what I've been doing. I am open to options on ways to

earn an income, if anything's available. I'm still waiting for my face to clear.

I'm not on anything illegal whatsoever. I have acne that just doesn't quite go away.

I keep thinking it's going to resolve itself. I'm taking like three or four showers a day

and scrubbing it with Neutrogena to try to get to clear. It just hasn't happened yet.

So as soon as that happens, you know, I'll probably be in a different category.

But this acne has been the most depilatory, you know, slowing me down thing possible.

So I'll do one last pan around here to show how busy this spot is. I'm gonna try to sit out in

the sun with the sun on my face for a while and see if I can just burn the acne off that way.

Uh, but uh, this is a popular place to be. I uh, I've stood out there before

and you know, the second I would get 10, 20 dollars in, I would just walk away.

So it's only good for 20 bucks. You know, I don't, I don't think I've ever,

never saw more than 20 bucks out of this spot. Because I was mostly pulled up by this point,

you know, it's pretty, pretty rare. Most of uh, most of the cardboard income I made was in Florida

and uh, even then, you know, one time I got a hundred dollars, but the rest of the time, you

know, it was one, two, maybe five dollars at a time. And you, the, the other problem is, um,

you're supposed to share the spot with other people. So, you know, you can only be out there

so long before, before sharing the spot with other people. Now only some people follow this rule

and uh, others, you know, either live in the spot or uh, uh, stay there all day

or sell merchandise. Um, which I always thought, you know, selling merchandise kind of stands on

freedom of speech because it is, it is originally there for uh, uh, you know, you lost your job,

you know, you got injured, some medical emergency, whatever. Uh, you have to go stand on the side of

the road with a sign that, that explains your situation. Um, that's what I always thought these

spots were for. Uh, selling merchandise on them, you know, there's plenty of places to put a store

front up to sell items. And I am completely for uh, uh, free trade and sales and, and running a

small business. Uh, but uh, you know, it'd be nice if, if uh, the people in need could have more spots

to explain their situation, um, rather than having these big operations come out. Because when I was

here earlier, there was people selling water and they must have had five trucks sitting in the,

in the median. So, uh, they were obviously doing well for themselves selling water on the side of

the road. I still don't have a car or any transportation whatsoever. So I'm stuck to this

one spot. I can use the bus, but it doesn't really seem to get me anywhere. I've tried it before. Uh,

the camera on the phone has been the most, uh,

most beneficial, uh, tool I've had at my disposal. So anyway, stay tuned.

After being on the road so long or out of house, one of the skills I had to

develop was learning how to sew my pants back together. Because, you know, for some

reason, how they develop pants, you know, the inseam of the center always

rips. Now, these pants have ripped and my poor blue jeans. I have two patches ironed

on and on the inside there's two more. And I stitched them on there, trying to

get it to stop peeling up, but it's still, this iron, you know, it doesn't hold very

well, so I have to use needle and thread to sew the patches actually on. This

iron, this is the material for that iron, and it just will not stick at all. I

followed the directions and did everything they said, but it will not

stick. So I have three pairs of pants and two of them are now ripped, so I get to

spend the day sewing this back together. I'm not very good at it, as you can tell,

because it keeps ripping, but you can see my stitches along there. You know, I just

try to get the corners and most of the middle stitched in there so they patch,

but these poor blue jeans have been through a lot. You can see the whole knee

is ripped up in them too. They have been through years of hard use, and I keep

patching them. I don't know, because this patch kit, I think it was three dollars

for this thing, and these might have been three dollars too, whereas a new pair of

blue jeans is 20 bucks. So I've probably reduced the need for another pair of

blue jeans. I'm saving some money, you know, I'm trying to reduce cost as much

as possible, and it is a good skill to have, just being able to hand sew ripped

clothing back together. I wish I was a little faster and a little better at it.

It's a long time-consuming process that, you know, you think, oh it'll take five

minutes to stitch that back together, and it takes hours, and I'm not the

best in the world, but, you know, after patching up the blue jeans the second

time, you know, I patched them up once and I got a good three months out of them

before they started to rip again, and the the second rip was just the the patch

peeling up. So I'm just gonna stitch that back down and get these done, and then,

because my patch doesn't match this material, I don't know what I'm gonna do

with this thing. They sell, you know, I get most of this at Walmart, so they sell

patch material at Walmart, but I don't know if they have this kind of material.

It makes clothing last considerably longer, like you get way more miles out

of it, and these clothes have a lot of walking miles on them. I think that's why

they keep wearing down, because I was walking everywhere before. I'm not

walking as much now, but before, like last year, I was I was walking a lot of miles

just here, there, and everywhere. I tried to get some videos on here of it that

were uploaded, but that's what really wore down my poor pants. So I'm gonna keep

trying to fix them, and it seems like the longer I can make them last, the

better. Anyway, stay tuned.

I'm on my daily walk to Walmart.

I'm probably just gonna look at new pants. I still have $110 left of that $4.92,

so it's enough for a pair of pants. I was just trying to get as much out of those old ones as

possible. I once again, you know, I sometimes feel compelled to take a nap midday, and I did

that today, and now I won't be able to sleep tonight. You know, it's just that simple of a

thing. I'll just fall asleep midday, wake up, and then won't be able to sleep at night. So I still

haven't quite gotten through whatever that thing is. I remember my dad used to have the same

problem, but I think he would sleep at night. He would take a nap midday and then sleep at night,

whereas in my case, you know, take a nap midday and then not be able to sleep at night. So

because Walmart's still open, you know, I still have something to do at least.

It's the worst at like 2 or 3 a.m. because there is absolutely nothing,

and I'll just be stuck awake. So stay tuned.

Over the past couple years I've made a point of keeping the receipts to everything I buy

because I've been buying stuff with donations and walking around with a backpack

and you know probably don't look the cleanest half the time. So I've been keeping the receipts

just in case anyone questions me. Like I have the receipt for this backpack from

I don't know two years ago, three years ago. I have the receipt for this on tablet from two

or three years ago that started this whole thing. This is all of them. These are all the receipts

I have for electronics I've bought and and like the boots I'm wearing and I even have the receipt

for the boots before these boots and my clothing and I just kept all the receipts so I could prove

I legitimately purchased everything. Now that brings me to the cell phone. I bought it like

a week ago maybe a week and a half ago and I'm having issues with it focusing and I have the

receipt and the box and the well the receipt in the box for the screen protector and the cell phone

case but for some reason I can't find the receipt for the actual cell phone and I've dug around

everywhere. As I just said you know I keep receipts for everything and I have the box and all the

manuals and everything for the phone but not the receipt. This is now the only thing I've I've had

to return this entire time or wanted to had any desire to return and just replace for the same

phone is this phone and I have no way to do that now so I'm stuck with this one that that stays out

of focus. I've been trying to get it to clear itself for the past week trying different third

party applications and you know all the settings in the camera just to get it to focus because when

I'm walking or when there's anything moving in the background it goes out of focus and sometimes

you know completely sitting still you'll just see it start blurring back and forth trying to

focus itself. So it's been an ordeal you know I almost got it exchanged without the receipt. I

went to customer service at Walmart, took like 20 minutes of explaining. They said okay if you

bring the same exact phone up I'll exchange for the same exact phone. Went back to electronics

they said oh we don't carry that phone anymore it'll be a long time before there's another one.

I mean I bought this thing a week ago how they they stopped carrying the phone entirely.

It was just one woman back there that kind of looked briefly in the case and then said there

weren't any other phones there was no way to return it. So that completely ruined my chances of

of swapping out the phone for a camera that focuses because the sole reason I bought this phone is for

the higher resolution camera that's better than the track phone's camera better than the BlueView 2's

camera. It was the sole reason for the purchase and the camera doesn't focus on it.

So I'm gonna it's a battle to say the least. Anyway stay tuned.

So I was thinking about other ways to make money and like I said before, I renovated a foreclosure

in Las Vegas and lived in the house for like six, seven years. Because I'm in Austin now,

there's a lot of similarities between Austin and Vegas. Vegas just sits a lot lower than Austin,

like in the water. Probably a bad choice of words because there's a lot more water in Austin than

Vegas. But some of the stuff, you know, some of the skill set I learned in Vegas, I can use in

Austin. One of those being, you know, renovating foreclosures or trailers even. You know, I had

one single wide trailer during my housing purchases. But just renovating old, like,

I think those houses were built in the 80s and the trailer was built in the 70s.

Renovating old houses in that time period, rather than trying to tear them down and build a huge

development in its place, because that gets really difficult. Just going around renovating

houses that are already standing and just need paint and plumbing and electrical and

all sorts of honking going on. Anyway, all different types of repair, the roofing,

stuff like that. That's all stuff I've done before. And you can take an old 80s house

and make it look close to new, at least in the interior, maybe the exterior, you know,

because architectural designs have changed, it's more difficult to make an old house look new.

But on the interior, you can make an old house look like a new house, just with lighting fixtures

and different countertops and a fresh coat of paint. You know, that, I can't remember the

name of it. It's a type of flooring, fake wood flooring. They have full-on fake wood flooring,

and then they have the almost tile flooring, where you notch the wood pieces together,

I don't know what it's called. It's some kind of plastic flooring. That's what I had in one

of my houses in Vegas, and it did a really good job. It made the house look much, much better.

I think I got that stuff at Lowe's, and I did have to hire people to install it,

but it was considerably cheaper than the other options that were available.

And it did a really good job making the house look clean and new and nice.

The other, you know, I had two of those houses then, and the other one, the half-acre with a pool,

it was in much worse shape when I bought it, but it took a lot more work to renovate.

I lost money on one and made money on another. The one that was pretty close to a turnkey house,

when I bought it, I lost money on. And then the one that was a foreclosure that was half falling

apart, you know, everything was broken, I made money on. So I make money on houses that are

in need of repair. So I'm going to start looking around Austin and looking around

different contractor companies to see if anyone's hiring so I can go work just renovating houses.

So anyway, stay tuned.

So I'm back sitting at this pond, and I was watching space movies, Armageddon most specifically.

I was thinking about, you know, all the asteroids that have hit Earth, and ways to stop them,

because that's what that movie was about, and the asteroid belt, and then Mars and Mars rovers.

As far as Mars, you know, because Starship is coming along so well,

now it's turned into, what do you do with it? You know, it's a big heavy hauler spaceship,

and like you could build a space station, you could land a rover on Mars.

And I started thinking about those asteroids, and you know, the asteroids in the asteroid belt,

and how you could land like a rover on one of them, and learn about the asteroids.

And how they orbit, and what would happen if you like, if you land a craft on one side of an

asteroid, does it knock it, it would change its orbit around the Sun then. So like, what would

its new orbit be, and how do you compensate for it, and all those questions. I was also

thinking about terraforming Mars, because Mars is so cold, you know, the first thing you think

is, well, how do you warm it up? And because there's a very weak ionosphere, which is the

magnetic field around Mars, you would have to build that up first. And two ways I found to do

that was, the core is really small, so it has a much smaller core than Earth. If you've got a

bunch of those asteroids, put a bunch of metal in the core of Mars, that would increase

the magnetic field around the planet. At least, you know, this is another one of my theories, you

know, I just think about for a while, and maybe it works, maybe it doesn't. But if you put a bunch of

like iron in the core of Mars, if you drill down to the center, put a bunch of iron in the core,

that would probably cause the ionosphere to be stronger. And then it would block solar winds,

and help the atmosphere stay on the planet, and not get blown off by solar winds.

The second thing is, those asteroids, they're in the asteroid belt. If you got a bunch of them,

and you know, just hauled them over to Mars, and piled them on the planet to increase the mass

of Mars as a whole, that would, you know, you'd take it up to like 70% Earth size, or 80% Earth

size, that would probably increase the atmosphere, and the gravity, and the warmth of the planet.

Because then you have more gravity holding on more atmosphere, and that causes greenhouse effects,

and would warm up the planet. Now this is pretty far-fetched, you know, building a ship to be able

to haul asteroids to Mars would be difficult. Like you'd need a skyscraper with a nuclear

reactor, and some kind of way to like attach itself to asteroids to haul them around, and it

would take decades. I don't know how fast you could go with a nuclear-powered ion thruster spaceship,

but it's got to be faster than the solar panel ones we're using now. I had a whole theory when

I was in Florida, I had a whole theory about how to build a skyscraper in space, and have it

powered with nuclear reactor, and like a reductive cooling system where you pump the

water through radiators, and that cools it back down after going through the reactor, and then back

into the reactor, and that generates electricity. So it'd just be another steam engine in space.

That's as far as I got with it though. I don't know how feasible it is. I've been wondering

why there haven't been any nuclear-powered spaceships. You know, once you get them to space,

you know, you need to truck around places. Well, how do you move them around? And they're using

all these rocket engines. You can't just haul a nuclear reactor, like one of the nuclear power

plants, the whole design, just haul it to low earth orbit or geostationary orbit, and park it

there, and have a nuclear power plant sitting in space that generates like two gigawatts or

something. So that's something I thought about, because with that much electricity, you can

fire up those ion thrusters and have just a million of them on the back of the thing,

and have them run on like radon, because they run on any of the noble gases. So radon is cheap. You

could just put a bunch of radon in it and burn the radon to propel yourself around, and go to

Mars and the asteroids, and actually have enough power to do something, to actually move stuff

around and create a construction project. But that got me, once I pulled back from everything that's

so far-fetched, and I thought, well, because Starship is so big, and it's pointed mostly at

Mars, I know they have a couple other missions for it, but it's pointed mostly at Mars, and now what

do you do with it? What do you haul to Mars? And you could probably get a good-sized rover

going up there with that Starship. So the ones we have now, Curiosity and Perseverance,

the tires are, you know, they don't even have rubber tires on them, and they go like a fraction

of a mile an hour. You know, with like a 6x6 Alaska off-road vehicle, if you put one of those

nuclear reactors in it, and just let it truck around wherever it wants, I don't know, you could

pick up a lot more speed. And I don't know why they didn't put rubber tires on Perseverance or

Curiosity. It seems like they would be okay. There's got to be some kind of run-flat rubber

tire you can put on that, that'll go to 200 degrees below zero, and still function. Which, that would

be the first thing I'd change on the existing rovers, is just putting actual tires on them,

and letting them pick up a little more speed than they do now. So that would be a good mission for

Starship. The other mission I thought of, you know, it could it could do a low-Earth orbit

space station, or a geostationary space station, meaning the space station would always sit

on the same spot over the Earth, always. So like you look up in the sky, and that space station

would be sitting in the exact same spot all the time. That would help with some of the

international conflicts, because it's just not flying over the whole planet, it's just

sitting over one town. So those are the two projects I had for Starship. I don't know

how feasible they are. Anyway, stay tuned!

I saw on the news a hurricane is headed for Central Texas, although it looks like it's

going to downgrade to a tropical storm. I doubt, you know, there'll be much high-speed wind

and all the drama of a hurricane hitting Texas, but at least where I am, maybe along the coast.

But if you go down south to Cancun, you can see it's going to slam into Cancun pretty hard.

I don't know how big that hurricane is. I've been to Cancun a few times, and

this is the first time I've seen one directly run into Cancun, Mexico. It's a really fun spot. You

know, what brought all this up was bringing up memories of Cancun, and I've been scuba diving

down there. I went scuba diving one time when I was in high school. Well, we went down on a

camping trip and got a resort for the week and went scuba diving all week, saw all the

fish. We went during the day and then at night, and you could see all the night glowing stuff,

too. So that was quite a bit of fun. And then when I lived in Vegas, I went on like a week-long or

two-week-long trip to Cancun and just went snorkeling on that trip, but it was a big party.

So I have always liked Cancun. I hope everything goes okay with this hurricane going right into it.

Once it gets to Texas, I don't know how much is going to be left of it, but

Cancun is like right in the eye of the thing. So after having so much history down there,

hope everyone stays safe and it goes smoothly. Anyway, stay tuned.

So part of being without money for so long is I can't see a dentist for anything. Like I haven't

been to a dentist or a doctor in years and years and years and my teeth I'm really careful about.

So I have to make sure they're they're brushed like three or four times a day and now I've not,

you know, I don't ingest any sugar and I was drinking some beer but the beer was making

my teeth sore too so I have to be really careful about it now and I had to give up on beer. So now

I have no sugar and no beer in my diet and which sucks but I have my teeth are all original and

I've never had any cavities filled in although I have two dents. I'm not sure

how well that's going to focus but I have two dents in my front teeth

and they're like my indicator for how my teeth are doing. The beer Mountain Dew was the worst

for my teeth. Mountain Dew was what it would hurt them the most. Beer is a close second.

It's pretty bad too so I had to I had to give up drinking when I was just having a few beers

in the evening just kind of enjoying watching tv and having a few beers but now with my teeth sore

I just switched toothpaste to from the whitening toothpaste to that cavity protection

erosion protection stuff. So hopefully that helps because I'm still running on all original teeth

at 42 years of age at some point you know I'm gonna have to make enough to go see a dentist

and get them actually professionally cleaned and and any erosions filled in which I'm not

even sure it's a procedure but hopefully it is. It should be you know it it looks like at least

for me a pretty common issue and it would it would allow me to drink beer again which is

just about all I'd get out of it but you know beer's good you know there's nothing wrong with

beer. So anyway stay tuned!

Ever since getting in a plane crash, I've been more reluctant about going near aircraft.

This has turned me into avoiding airplanes entirely. As a little child, I used to throw up

when we flew around in a little bush plane, and even as a teenager, I was hesitant about learning

how to fly. I did enjoy the flight simulator, however. Growing older, I had given up on flying

altogether, but a friend of mine got his pilot's license. We went on a few times. On the last trip,

we bounced off the runway and collided with a fence at maybe 45 miles an hour.

The plane tumbled, but we both walked away. After that, I had given up entirely on small-engine

aircraft. Years later, I got a job working for the military, but it required a lot of travel.

It lasted six months before running out of motivation to work the job. It was too much

flying around and was making me too unstable. As I've been reading the Bible more, I've learned

that the church has always been sort of against aircraft in general. I tried to do my own

translation on what the church is trying to say. The best I can come up with is we shouldn't fly

around in the atmosphere because it's a waste of resources. Wait until you get into heaven,

i.e., space, to fly around. That's the best I can do with the interpretation. This means

whoever is on the other side of the Bible will help us feel comfortable in space.

This is another one of my theories that may or may not be true, but it sounds good.

There's more that isn't included in the Bible. One thing is don't go to the moon as it disrupts

the planet too much. It causes gravity differences between the two balanced with each other. It may

not cause an issue right now, but thousands of years or even millions of years in the future,

it may cause the planet's climate to become unstable. I've determined it's not worth the

risk and would avoid any moon projects entirely. I think this applies to any planet's moon. If we

go there, it causes disruption on the existing planet regardless of what is on the surface.

This has caused me to avoid projects to the moon of any planet. The rest of space seems to be okay.

The only other issue I found that could be caused are by knocking asteroids out of their

existing orbit and into the planet and using too many resources to try to accomplish something.

In conclusion, because airplanes don't serve a purpose anymore and are just a waste of resources,

I will be avoiding them, but space still seems to be okay because it's something we have not

yet accomplished. That is as long as the issues I outlined are avoided. Anyway, stay tuned!

Just like every night, I get woken up at 12, 1, or 2 a.m. and can't get back to sleep.

I go to sleep at 9 or 10, which is normal, but getting woken up in the middle of the night

is an issue, you know, and I don't know what's doing it.

Every time I wake up I'm reminded of all the houses and cars I had in Nevada.

Uh, there were two ranches and two houses at the peak of it,

and a bunch of cars and a bunch of belongings, bunch of motorcycles, dune buggy,

I don't know, computer equipment, stuff like that, and it all just kind of

uh, uh, slowly went away. I didn't really do anything wrong, um, just, uh, uh, couldn't

maintain what I had, and uh, uh, it all really started when my dad was at this cattle ranch

in northern Nevada, and uh, somehow they, uh, they got him to sell the property,

and uh, it was then not owned by us anymore. It, I moved him down to Las Vegas, and the whole thing

kind of fell apart without that, that cattle ranch in our possession. So I don't know if that's what

caused the whole thing, but it, it sure caved in everything I had, and uh, uh, it was, it was

impossible to recover, at least for me. I just had to kind of bail on the whole thing, um, but that's

what's keeping me up at night. I would, uh, I would have saved what I could, but uh, it was,

it was impossible from the position I was in, and, and everything kind of coming at me. Like,

for instance, um, my dad's, uh, town property in Winnemucca, the second I stepped foot there,

I had people showing up, uh, trying to buy his bush plane, and I just gave up and just sold it to

him without, uh, having, you know, without having any time to really decide if, if I even wanted the

thing or, or what to do with it. Um, they were pushing in so much that it was just, just sell

it to them and get out of there, uh, so I wouldn't be put in any danger. Um, but it was, it was a

bunch of, uh, little, uh, little things like that that caused the whole thing to cave in,

so that's what's keeping me up at night. Anyway, stay tuned.

Trying to figure out where I'm supposed to be and because I'm low on income, you know,

just finding the the best place to work has been been a considerable motivation.

But going back to Winnemucca and Reno and all of northern Nevada, we had that cattle ranch

in a town, I hate to use the phrase almost like Winnemucca because it was nothing like Winnemucca.

Where I was actually conceived was at that cattle ranch and the nearest town to it is this whole

town called Unionville which is, I don't know, 30 minutes off the interstate and way up in the

mountains. But it was the closest town to that ranch and the ranch itself, the nearest neighbor

was 20 miles away so it was pretty far out there. You know, you needed a four-wheel drive truck

to get out there most times because either the road would flash flood in the summer

or there'd be so much snow in the winter that you couldn't make it out there. You'd need a

oh there's thunder going off, you'd need a snowmobile to get out there. So we only had like

15 cows at the ranch at its peak. I think it was 15 and they were very tame and very pets.

I had a few pet cows in Winnemucca too. One dairy steer and another

female cow, I can't remember what breed she was, but the dairy steer, you know, I bottle fed him

from a very little calf and he was like a dog but we got moved away and then he died from something.

Going back, I don't know what I'd do if I went back to Winnemucca. Probably just look for some

rink-a-dink job. My parents were both car dealers so we were kind of hovering around the casinos a

lot in Winnemucca. You know, they're not very big. You just got little teeny tiny ones that haven't

changed in 40-50 years. I don't know. I have multiple ideas. You know, I've lived in Reno before.

I just lived at Boomtown in the trailer park. They have a little RV park

just, let's see, west of Reno. Kind of halfway up the mountains and then once you keep going

up the mountains you hit Lake Tahoe and Truckee. But I've lived there because it was like $600 a

month and I had a little 19-foot travel trailer I was living in and there's a lot more work in Reno.

But technically, Winnemucca is where I'm from and technically that's where the cattle ranch was

that I got all this experience in ranching. That, you know, is kind of going to waste because

I don't have a way to take care of cows here in Texas. So I don't know what inspired my parents

to get that thing. My dad was a pilot on top of working for the casinos and he would train people

how to fly. So a lot of the money came from him flying people around. Now I don't know how much

of it was based on that airplane. He would fly it out there and land at the ranch. So I don't know

if the airplane kind of helped build the house and then without the airplane, you know, it doesn't

have that that way to make room for itself and runs out of space. I don't know how well it would

work without having that airplane boost coming in to kind of build the house. It's difficult to

explain but something about, you know, when you build a house with an airplane and then you don't

have the airplane anymore, the house kind of caves in. Like the airplane is getting room from the

air for the house to be built. So trying to build that place without any sort of aviation, you know,

just using four-wheel drive trucks and snowmobiles and quads and stuff, well you'd have to like go to

town and then make a bunch of friends and then you and all those friends would have to go out there

and kind of build the house. So it's probably possible but it might be difficult. So anyway, stay tuned.

So growing up at that cattle ranch we had

Gold and silver that when my dad would like hide various places. So it's really weird

But later when I grew up I learned, you know, people get really aggressive over precious metals

And to me at this point, they're probably not worth the effort

Um, I had a little dirt bike

That I ended up selling in Kingman, Arizona, and I traded it for these silver coins

There were one ounce silver

Coins, I can't remember what they were worth. I ended up getting like 20 of them for the dirt bike and

Remember the second I had him sitting in my van

It was you know, it just created nothing but paranoia and these were just silver coins

They weren't worth that much

It was uh, maybe 300 hours worth or something

But you know, I could just feel this intensity coming off just having that the silver coin sitting there

And gold, you know gold has got to be considerably

More tense than that, especially in with a good quantity of it

So, I don't know if it's really worth

Having precious metals sitting around

because you're just gonna end up being so paranoid trying to guard it all day that

It's not worth having in the first place. Now jewelry on the other stand, other hand, you know, that's what I was thinking at the time

Because

Because I'm from Nevada, you know, it's really easy to

Dig up, you know the raw or I mean there's gold and silver mines all over the state

So it's really easy to dig up the raw

raw metal, but

actually

Sculpting it into something useful

a car nearly

Spun out right there. It just rained

having the raw metal and like turning it into jewelry or

something

Of interest, you know that gives it some value

But the the raw metal itself isn't worth very much to me just because I know it has a high cash value

but the actual

Actual worth of your lifestyle having to guard this precious metal

Isn't worth it. So the the full package just isn't worth having it sitting there

But converting it into jewelry and

Whatever little trinkets you can get out of it

That has some value and there is money to be made

getting the raw metal and

Then having a jewel your jaw

Converted into jewelry or

trinkets or

whatever else you can make out of it that makes some money in and of itself because you can just buy the

Base metal and then convert it into jewelry and sell the jewelry at a considerable profit

Because you're using such little precious metal to make it

that would probably have a pretty good profit margin if you

if you could find the right supplier for the the

Base or and

Then the right jaw or jaw to to sculpt it and then sell it

Don't know how easy it would be

To get an operation like that going but there's got to be some money in it. Anyway, stay tuned

So I'm stuck awake all night again. It's like 3 a.m. now and the biggest concern I'm having

is uh I bought a new pair of pants and it was uh it threw off my budget a little bit so now uh

because all my my pants had ripped I had to buy another pair and that has thrown off my budget

because I'm not getting money out of TikTok until the 15th and uh that's like eight days from now

so I'm down to uh 34, 35 dollars and uh I've been using it to buy food and now I'm gonna

be able to buy food but I'm not gonna be able to buy vape so uh I don't know how to uh how to

balance my budget um to have vape and food. It's uh pretty funny I ran it that close and not even

realizing it but I tried to stitch my pants back together and just couldn't pull it off

so ended up buying a new pair of pants uh which is what's what caused now my budget crunch um

I wish I wasn't like so dependent on vape but uh it's just you know one of those things I can

swap it around you know I can swap it between like soda and candy and ice cream and whatever

you know and just make it that thing and then when I want to grab that thing I'll go grab it

but vape is what I made that thing be and uh uh running out then you know now I don't have

quote unquote that thing so um uh I uh I wish I uh made more money last month but uh

I'm gonna keep chipping away at how to keep my budget down. I uh I bought a lot of food um

maybe it was too much food but it's nothing very expensive you know I'm just shopping at Walmart

and it's just a basic uh like the last two food items I bought were sardines and a pizza

um and those little uh uh juice mixes that you can make a pitcher of juice out of with

with one mix that costs like I don't know it it comes out so cheap that it's like

uh 30 cents a pitcher or something so it's extremely cheap uh juice mixes and you know I'll

get uh 10 glasses or well maybe not 10 five glasses seven glasses out of one pitcher so it's

really cheap juice um that's about as as uh cheap as I can run everything and I still ran out of

money um so uh I I did email my mom after not emailing her for like a month and the only thing

she would provide is uh an update on my cell phone monthly plan but uh wouldn't provide food or the

pants I was requesting so uh I'm still stuck you know it's difficult to get over this ledge to get

to the next one um when your pants are ripped up and you don't have food and you can't sleep at

night um so I'm I'm climbing my way up as steadily and uh safely as possible anyway stay tuned

For about a week there, I was drinking beer pretty good. And I don't know what happened,

but I still have like nine beers of a 12-pack sitting in my fridge, and it's been sitting

there now for a week. So I just stopped having the desire to drink all of a sudden.

Which, I don't know, because I was in Vegas for so long, I drank a lot while I was there.

Drinking beer now, you know, it's not as exciting as it once was.

So I'm just not as motivated. Also, my teeth are getting sore,

so I don't want to do any unnecessary damage to my teeth

with beer or with Mountain Dew or any sugar. So I just kind of stopped, and now that

that case of beer is like stuck in my fridge. And, you know, I'll have no food in the fridge

whatsoever, except for this case of beer. So I don't know, you know, once I get my teeth to

repair a little bit with this new enamel toothpaste, I'll probably just kind of

sip through the last of that 12-pack and not buy another. But it was pretty relieving that

that my beer drinking

week kind of just shut down on its own. And, you know, it's one less thing to worry about.

I don't need or crave or have to have alcohol. So the last of my bad habits is just vape.

Everything else is gone. And, you know, the vape, you know, like I'm showing now,

I have to wear this nose brace because I feel shortness of breath. And

when I'm trying to sleep, it's like, I don't know if I think about it too much,

but my nose will clog. And the second I put a Breathe Right strip on it, it declogs and then

I can breathe normally. But the clogging isn't a type of respiratory distress. It's just

too much mucus in my nose. And I don't know where it's coming from,

or if there's a way to change my thought process on it to fix it. But it is the most irritating

thing. It is helping me reduce vape. And like I said before, I haven't had a cigarette in a long

time and I really don't want one. But nicotine is such an addictive substance that, you know,

it's always kind of lingering in the background. And I hope, you know, because I haven't been

getting as much exercise as normal, that may not be helping my breathing. Like if I go get

good exercise and really get, you know, my heart rate up and breathing heavy, then that'll help

clear my lungs out to make breathing easier. But I knew this might be an issue

because cigarettes were so prevalent from when I was like 18 years old until a month ago.

I knew I may end up having shortness of breath as I got older. So I'm going to try to

learn breathing exercises and various routines to get my breathing as strong as it can be.

This nose breathing issue, I think it's unrelated. It's, you know, ever since I've

ever since I was a little kid, you know, I've had to sleep on one side. Like I can only sleep

on my right side because my nose would clog if I sleep on my left side. And when I have a

breatharide strip, that isn't an issue. I can sleep on either side and my nose works great.

So I may have a partially like collapsed nasal passage and that's what's causing the

breathing issues. But, you know, me not getting enough exercise isn't helping and me

smoking cigarettes for 20 years isn't helping either. So I hope I am done for good with

cigarettes. The vape, you know, I'll use it once in a while and slowly just wean off the

last of the nicotine addiction. And the downside of it is, you know, it's kind of a hobby and then,

you know, you don't have that thing anymore. So you have to find someone to replace it with.

So I bought this chewing gum just to reduce, you know, having to grab something and put it in my

mouth. You know, I can just do that with chewing gum, which seems to be working, although it comes

with issues of its own because my jaw gets sore from chewing chewing gum so much. So I probably

just need more hobbies. You know, maybe I'll work on film production and how to make these clips.

A little more professional, but I'm steadily making progress. Anyway, stay tuned.

Once again, I woke up too early and couldn't get back to sleep. You know, I got strangely

woken up and I fell back to sleep and then woken up again. So, I gave up. I'm like,

I'm just gonna go walk around and see if any footage should appear. And then I started

thinking about, you know, what stories to tell and what's inhibiting me from working.

And my face has been the biggest factor. But transportation is also another issue.

And, you know, it's impossible. There is absolutely no way to get transportation.

So, I would have to walk on foot to whatever job will hire me. Which, you know,

yeah, it's a difficult ledge to climb over. Let's put it that way. So, you know,

how do you go from absolutely no money, no food, or very basic food, you know, I'm eating ramen

noodles, to being an employed member of society. And there's this huge ledge to climb over

to get to employment. And the biggest hurdle is transportation. So, I'm going through it all and,

you know, the bus is an option. But, you know, you really expect a person to have

a car to go to work. And with no money, no car, it's, you know, how? So, I started looking at cars.

And I've had a bunch of Subarus in the past. I was looking on Craigslist for the cheapest one

available. Because, you know, sometimes you can find those things for a thousand bucks.

And I never worked on them very much. But I have a lot of experience with them. And,

you know, I worked on some. I could do, like, some serpentine belts and batteries and spark plugs.

Well, maybe spark plugs. That thing's horizontally opposed. So, the spark plugs are on the side of

the engine. So, some of the repairs are more difficult because of how the engine is built.

But Subarus have always been good. You know, if I continue with the TikTok thing

and keep making videos, Subarus are good for getting through the mud like you wouldn't believe.

They are so lightweight. At least the older ones. I don't know about the new ones.

But the older ones, you know, they weigh like 2,500 pounds and have four-wheel drive.

So, they don't sink into the mud, the way, or sand, or any sort of obstacle.

They don't sink in as much as modern vehicles. I wish they would make modern vehicles lighter.

But, for some reason, you know, cars just keep getting heavier and heavier.

Anyway, I'm going to keep browsing around. Sometimes, you know, Subarus get given away.

They're so cheap. And that would able me to get to work, at least. I don't know if there's some

channel or different way I'm supposed to be taking than what I'm doing. But, you know,

from the spot I'm in, it's impossible to be in the right bracket to be an employed member of society.

There's no way up this ledge. You know, I guess I could take out a bank loan.

But you need proof of income to take out a loan to go to work. And the other issue is all the

crimes my parents committed. I have to explain all those. And I don't have the full story.

And my mom, this is another thing. You know, she's sitting on a lot of money.

And I'm her only family member. So I have to explain what she's doing with all this money

without having access to any of the money myself. So I can't really do anything. You know,

I've informed the police multiple times about everything I know. And I can't get the thing to

dislodge itself. The next issue is everything she has is appreciating. So her house in Vegas

and all the precious metals are appreciating in value. And that's earning more money.

And which puts more pressure on me. So now I have more pressure on me

involving money I have no access to, which is a serious problem.

And that's also inhibiting me from work because she's sitting on all this money

that's earning more money. And it makes me look greedy somehow that I'm trying to earn money on

top of that when I don't have access to any of it to begin with. So it's a frustrating,

difficult situation. I'll stay I'll keep updates going on it. Anyway, stay tuned.

Well, because I'm in Austin, that hurricane appears to have changed course and went over Houston.

It didn't even come this way. I thought there was going to be a little rain.

Now, I did notice the weather report said it was going to make landfall on Monday, and it actually made landfall on Sunday.

I don't know. When I looked at this thing a few days ago, it really looked like it was going to make landfall on Sunday.

I don't know where they thought it was going to happen on Monday.

Anyway, you can see it's like halfway across Houston or three-quarters across Houston now.

But me in Austin, you know, I can point this out the window, there is not much going on.

There's no rain. There's like light wind. No hurricane fiasco going on here.

I've been through quite a few tropical storms. You know, I can't confirm if I've been through a hurricane or not.

But I've been through a few tropical storms, and they were pretty intense.

You know, you'd see the palm trees blowing around, and leaves and debris would blow around everywhere.

Sometimes trees would fall over. It was interesting, to say the least.

I wish I got to see this one. You know, I was thinking what type of vehicles you could drive through the thing in that would make it safely.

Everyone always seems to think everything's going to blow over.

I don't know. You know, driving through, like I was looking at Subarus, really lightweight Subarus,

and them blowing over from a hundred mile an hour wind, I don't know.

Maybe if it was like tilted some weird way to where the wind could get under it.

But I think it would probably stay on the ground pretty sure-footed.

I've always been kind of a thrill-seeker, storm-chaser.

Being from the desert, I'm really entertained by rain and storms and hurricanes and tornadoes and all that stuff,

because it's just so foreign for me.

The desert, you know, there's no precipitation or very little precipitation.

I mean, the monsoons, there's a little bit of rain in the monsoons.

But the rest of the year, there's not much.

So having access and learning about all these storms is really interesting.

I wish, you know, like I said, I wish I got to see this one.

I was hoping it would blow over Austin just so I could record it and show the footage and everything.

But it had to change course.

I did notice it dropped down to a Category 1, whereas it was like a Category 4 when it hit Cancun.

So considerably smaller once it finally got here.

But it's pretty interesting to learn, you know, how they move.

And it did kind of stall when it got to the coast.

So them saying it was going to arrive on Monday and it actually arrived on Sunday,

well, it did stall on the coast a little bit.

But I would think, you know, this classifies as the hurricane making landfall on Sunday and not Monday.

How they got that thing a day off, I don't even know.

I'm going to keep learning about the weather.

Anyway, stay tuned.

In my past, you know, I started out on a cattle ranch, and then we moved around quite a bit.

Like I said, you know, a portion of my childhood was spent in Winnemucca,

which is an old Native American name. I think the name of the chief of the Indian tribe that

was out there was named Winnemucca, and then I think that was the first place where like

the settlers kind of made peace with the Native Americans in the West, and it became a town.

So a lot of my past includes interactions with the Native Americans, and I don't know,

the only, you know, I've only had one bad experience, well maybe two bad experiences,

but one was they were blasting their music at the apartment just below me, and I started

stomping up and down on the floor to get them to quit having the music so loud, and while doing

this they got really upset and started slamming into my front door, and it was a huge mess. Now

what they would do, these were like 350, 400 pound guys, what they would do is they would

drink so much, and then they'd just start fighting with each other in the apartment they were in.

So this got bad, and that was the first bad interaction I had. The rest of the time was

fine, you know, we got along fine with each other. It was just that one thing, and then I had a

girlfriend who was Native American, and we got along well enough, although I just couldn't get

the relationship to quite go, you know, it just wouldn't work completely. So ended up breaking up

with her, and then had another girlfriend who was Native American, and her brother and I would

kind of squabble with each other. It wasn't the worst, because I got along with him pretty well

too, but still it was too much. I couldn't get the relationship to work, so I gave up on that one too.

Plus they all seemed to like to drink more than I wanted to. So that was the end of my

Native American relationships, but I got a lot of experience out of them, and I learned a lot about,

you know, how they are, and I like a bunch of their ideas. You know, I still get along with

the Native Americans too well. I never did that cowboys and Indians thing, cowboys versus Indians,

because I would always try to, like, learn from the Indians. So going back, you know,

some of their ideas are pretty good. One, I saw Navajo Nation went on some protest about people

going to the moon and thinking it was a bad idea. I completely agree with them on it. Now they said

that going to the moon is like some sacred ground, and you shouldn't be there. And the

analysis I came to about going to the moon is that it, like, moves the orbital shift of the planet.

So you're, like, changing the climate when you go up there, and no one quite knows what it's gonna do

if you start moving the moon around having a bunch of ships landing on it. So I came to the same

conclusion as them, is the best bet is just stay away from the thing. So that was another reason I

just like the Natives, and they're really good about being extremely stationary. You know, not

using any gas, not using any resources, and just staying put. So I like them for that too.

Now in Austin, you know, it's a little different environment here. So I don't know what the

common assessment is. There's so many Latin, Colombian, Mexican, Central American people here

that the Native American population I don't think is as big. And it's interesting to learn from Latin

Americans like the Mayans and the Inca and the Aztecs. You know, they had their own tribes as well.

So they're interesting to learn from. The big benefit of the Native Americans is they can

just stay put. They have so much ground and so much foundation that you can, like,

stand in place and everything just goes around you. You don't even have to worry about moving

around at all. So that was the big benefit from interacting with Natives. Anyway, stay tuned!

Well, the only place I have to get a job is right here. I've tried for years to hold up a sheet of

cardboard saying I'm in need of work and waiting for the cars to go by to see if anyone will hire

me. Remember, I have no income whatsoever, so going from no income, my employer would have to

maintain housing and food, and then I would work for that employer. But because I have

no way to get over no income whatsoever, I can't get to a conventional job.

Now, what's missing is employers should be able to drive right past here looking for employees

and pick me up that way. I have no other way to get a job, and I've tried for three years

to get a job this exact way, and I only had very few hits on it. They were very short-lived.

I would sit outside with a sheet of cardboard in Florida, and I did home renovation. I cleaned

all the trash out of houses. Now, the guy who picked me up on the side of the road,

I went and worked for him for three or four days, and they were good eight-hour days.

He didn't pay. He dropped me back off on the side of the road and never paid.

I think I got like $15 out of it, and that was three days of hard work.

So this system right here is what's in my way. However you get employment without having an

income of any kind or guaranteed housing, see, my hotel room isn't guaranteed. It could disappear

at any minute. So there's no way to be able to maintain, you know, be reliable when I could

lose housing at any second. So the only, the absolute only way I can get a job is standing out

front here with a sheet of cardboard and begging for work, which I've tried to do. I tried to do

for years. The second I got ran out of Nevada, I immediately started trying that exact option,

and it didn't work, and that's what caused me to run around all over the place.

I finally had to resort to just basic cardboard, and then I, you know, once I got enough money in,

I got a tablet with that cardboard, and I used the camera on the tablet to upload a video to TikTok,

and that's what started this whole TikTok thing. But once again, you know, I am not in a position

to be able to be employed unless the employer is providing housing and food

right off the bat. Because, keep in mind, you know, I can't do laundry,

and I'm stuck awake at night every night for who knows what reason.

And I have a little bit of a vape addiction, although it's not the worst. I got it mostly

shrunk down to chewing gum, not even Nicorette chewing gum, just regular chewing gum.

And, you know, there's beer sitting in my fridge, but I'm not even drinking it.

So I have no bad habits, no drug addictions of any kind, and I have a strong

resume on previous employers. What caused me to become homeless and impoverished and

stranded in various places is I was working in Las Vegas for the casinos, and then I immediately

switched to working for the Department of Defense as a contractor. And that caused everything to

jam up really weird. And I wasn't expecting it. I thought it would be fine. It would just smoothly

transition over. Well, it didn't. You know, then I got scared of people breaking into my house.

People did start breaking into my house. So I finally had to sell the house and leave.

And then I wasn't close enough to the military to have any friends to get through.

And I had completely alienated myself in Nevada because now I was military and they didn't want

anything to do with the military. So that got me stuck in this middle no man's land.

And now, you know, I'm doing everything I can to earn a living.

And it's I can't find the next step to take. I have to be able to prove reliable housing

to work a conventional job. And as it sits now, the only reliable housing I have is out here

somewhere. So someone would have to pick me up on the side of the road and hire me that way and

then have a room to sleep in. And then I would just work whatever job. That's the only way I can

be employed at this point. And I have a really strong resume, you know, worked for the military

doing IT, ran my own business as a network administrator, network consultant, worked for

Target, Lowe's, Office Depot, Circuit City. Everything except for Target has a full

rehire. Worked for MGM Resorts International, worked for Boise State University, all with rehires.

So I never got arrested and the only firing was from Target and it didn't make any

sense. You know, they just randomly said I was laid off one day. Oh, I'm sorry. And

there was a defense contractor job I got laid off from. But that Target one, you know, they just

said I was fired one day and the reason was leaning on the counter. So I don't know what

happened there. I think because I was going through that military switch where I was just

telling my life story, that caused everyone in my entire old system in Nevada to fall apart

and that probably landed on Target while I was working there. So that was the issue with that

one. But I've worked 10 jobs since then and it's incredibly difficult when you are in this spot

to get employment. I mean, how? What do you do? A car has to drive by and hire you,

offer you money that minute and hire you in order to be employed. There is no other way

to do it. You know, I've been through this thing. Every possible angle, every possible direction,

you know, all the people to talk to and you just end up in this weird gear

where nothing works. So like me not being able to sleep at night and when I had to chase cigarettes

around everywhere, I couldn't turn off that chasing cigarettes around everywhere and that

was getting in the way of everything. So that's what's making it ludicrously difficult to be

employed. And this is with, keep in mind, I have no criminal history whatsoever and probably 20

previous employers I've worked for with a full rehire. But that full rehire is contingent on

having transportation and having a reliable home, which I don't have. So those rehires are null.

Um, and that leads me back to this only option, which is standing out here waiting for someone

to walk by or waiting for someone on TikTok to offer me a job that has transportation and has

housing. Anyway, stay tuned.

So, stuck awake all night. Slept most of the day. My sleep cycle is sporadic,

so I'll sleep for like a few hours and then wake up and then get tired in the middle of the day

and then wake up again. Anyway, everyone seems to constantly think I'm on drugs,

so I'll go through the drugs explanation again. Probably in 2000, 2001,

I was going to college. And while going to college, my mom convinced herself she had to

buy another ranch. And the only ranches that were available in her price range were in central rural,

extremely rural Nevada. And the one she ended up going with, and she asked my advice on which one

to buy. Because there was one over on the other side of the state, but there was this big,

beautiful one. And so, you know, I just go for the big, beautiful one. At that time,

I didn't know a bunch of druggies were using that place to do drugs,

and it had been that way for some time. That's why the property was for sale.

So they had been using that land to do drugs for some time. She bought the land remotely,

purchased it online. She might have seen it in person before buying it. I don't know.

Anyway, that must have upset them. So now you have these druggies that

are, you know, in and around Tonopah, Nevada. And now they're upset because they don't have

their spot because my mom bought it. So now I'm in Phoenix, Arizona, going to college at DeVry.

Somehow, this whole thing caught up with me. And I had guys from Tonopah, Nevada,

showing up in Phoenix, Arizona, just kind of being dodgy. And I, once again, you know,

this goes back to this apartment where I had these drunk Native Americans living downstairs

that would blast music all night, every night, and then slam into my front door if I asked them to

stop. And then the other side of this thing were these druggies that were probably from Nevada,

although I don't know. There were a few Arizona people in there. But at that time, I was flying

RC airplanes. And I probably, you know, I was an 18, 19 year old kid. I probably was too nice to

them, I guess, you know, at the RC airfield, which doesn't seem like much of an issue. But,

you know, you invite one guy over, and then he brings his friend over, and then friend of a

friend. Pretty soon, you know, I had 10 guys in my apartment that I couldn't get out of there. And

then they started bringing drugs over. So now, 19 years old, going to college,

I've got 10 or so guys showing up whenever and bringing drugs. I couldn't hold them off as much

as I know all the perfect people on TikTok that do everything absolutely perfect every time.

I couldn't hold them off as much as I would have liked. So because this was 20 years ago,

I can't confirm any substances that were used. But I do remember having to use a shotgun to run

them out of my apartment finally to get them out of there. And, you know, this is a lot for being

19 and just trying to go to college. So I got them and all the drugs out of my apartment.

But the damage had already been done. And any drug use by me would have been minuscule.

I was really I wanted to fly RC airplanes and go to college. I wasn't trying to

have much involvement in this thing. But because she bought that house, I really think that's what

tipped it over to where I had all these guys showing up at my apartment. Because she bought

that house that was there like druggy headquarters. So then I dropped out of college,

didn't touch anything illegal for years and years. And I think one time I got barely blipped in Vegas

because I broke up with my girlfriend and then all her little skinhead bodyguards started showing

up. And, you know, you just barely blipped the thing to get them out of there. And that's why

I did that time, too. And I was also minuscule, if any. But, you know, microscopic drug use

in my entire history. But I couldn't get it perfect zero because, you know, when you're

up against 10 guys who are bigger and stronger than you are, you just do what they say.

I heard stories about people getting held hostage and kidnapped.

I didn't want anything to do with it. So the safest path I could take at the time

was just go along with whatever they want and then run them off the first chance you get.

And that's what I ended up doing. So that, you know, that would be the extent of

my experience. And I don't want anything to do with drugs. I like alcohol.

So I don't want anything to do with drugs, even vape. I'm getting sick of vape. I'm still addicted

to nicotine, but I'm sick of vape. I don't do any prescriptions. I don't want any. I don't

have any prescriptions. I take a multivitamin every day. So, or, you know, I try to take a

multivitamin every day. But squeaky clean and trying to earn a living. Anyway, stay tuned.

So I'm sitting out on the side of the road. It's 3 a.m. I can't sleep. I only have $30 left to my name.

I was saving it to buy vape but I'll buy food if I need to. I'm completely out of food and

I don't know what the best option for me to take is. I've been uploading these videos for a while

and just trying to see the best way to make money. Anyway, thank you.

I've been going through Boeing's Starliner and how those astronauts are still stranded in space.

And, you know, there's got to be some rescue operations underway. I don't know what happened

to the Starliner other than its little helium leaks causing thrusters to malfunction. But

it still seems to be ongoing. The best I could come up with is to rescue it, or rescue the

astronauts, was first I went through the Soyuz Russian rocket and how they could do a rescue.

And then I went to the Chinese. And the Chinese also have a space program and their own space

station. Now apparently they had some fight with each other in 2011 and NASA refuses to work with

the Chinese on anything to do with space. Now the principle I was operating under

with anything to do with space was you have to settle any differences with any foreign powers

on the ground and then go to space. So if you're in space already you shouldn't be having a

disagreement with a different country, in this case China. So if China builds a space station and

the rest of the world builds a space station you should be able to get along fine with each other.

If that little handshake doesn't work then you shouldn't be in space in the first place.

So that's what caused these people to get stranded, at least in my opinion,

is because the United States wasn't working well enough with foreign governments

to have everything smoothed over before going to space. That's why they got stranded.

And now the rescue ship, the nearest, you know, the closest ship nearby if you talk like

shipping would be this Chinese one. And, you know, this happens in the ocean, you know,

you'll have a ship go down and a bunch of people stranded on a raft and then you have to send in

whatever ship's nearby to rescue them. So the nearest rescue ship would be that Chinese one.

I don't know what they're doing or what they're thinking but my first step would be

to make contact with the Chinese and see if they can they can launch a rocket to

the International Space Station. This is another one of these fights I can't stand

because, you know, from what I've learned from the space program since I was a little kid

is the International Space Station was built to promote international relations. So

getting along with the world and it works internationally. That's why it's the International

Space Station. Now this would mean it's not the International Space Station because it doesn't

include China. So I would redo the whole thing, redo space politics across the board so this

doesn't happen again. And the biggest one being ensure this handshake works so when you launch a

rocket up there you can contact a foreign power to rescue or help with the mission if needed.

We did this for the longest time with Russia and the Soviet Union in the 70s and 80s. First

the Soviets launched their little Mir space station and then I think they started allowing

U.S. astronauts on Mir and then that's when the International Space Station started to form.

It might have been Mir originally launched and then the Russians built a second space station

then the second space station became the International Space Station. And that was

working together with Russia that created the whole thing. Now currently, you know, we need to

work together with China to succeed in space. And having this much hostility between the two

countries is what's causing these astronauts to be stranded. So my first thing would be just

contact whoever has a rescue ship, fly it up there and rescue the people. Anyway, thank you.

I've been going through content ideas and space is a big one.

You know space, people are like talking about space, other stuff is wildlife animals

and I started digging up you know SpaceX and Boca Chica down south of here in south Texas

and they've been having a environmental wildlife protection problem down there because the

the activists are saying the rockets are disrupting the protected wildlife and I went

through the wildlife species that's down there and all I could find was these sea turtles that

are endangered and have been for quite a while. I think in like the 1970s there were millions and

millions of those sea turtles and people started taking all their eggs and that caused them to

become endangered and they've been endangered ever since. Now with this rocket launching you

know they're concerned this is going to further endanger the turtles. Those turtles, they're the

most fragile creature on the planet. When I was in Nevada a friend of mine was an environmental

biologist and she would protect the desert tortoise and the desert tortoise was the same

thing. It was critically endangered and you know it would everything was a predator to it because

it'd go like a fraction of a mile an hour and would park itself on roads anywhere so that that made it

very vulnerable to anything. Now going back to these sea turtles you know it's very similar

to the desert tortoise with these sea turtles. They crawl up on the beach and lay their eggs

and then crawl back to the ocean but they also go a fraction of a mile an hour and yeah they're

really easy to like want to pester while they're doing this. So I've had some experience with sea

turtles in Cancun. I saw them laying their eggs and then trying to get back to the water

while I was scuba diving or during a scuba diving trip. I think I was on the beach during the sea

turtles but while on that trip I got to see them on the beach and how vulnerable they were.

So I understand the activist side of it but there's got to be a way to fence it or pin them

away from the launch pad so the launches can continue and the sea turtles are still okay.

I was going through other species of endangered wildlife and the pandas are the other one.

These Chinese pandas you know we used to have them in the United States. They would keep them

at zoos and stuff and I just read online that the last two got shipped back to China or something

because some lease deal ran out and that seems kind of strange. You know it should be easy enough

to keep pandas in the country. I would keep pandas as pets if it were up to me. They have got to be

the most interesting looking bear of anything. I had a carillion bear dog which was a black and

white dog that almost looked like a panda although it was a dog. You could definitely tell he was not

a bear he was a dog. But you know it's the same like black and white kind of goofy nature as the

pandas. So I really like that black and white kind of look on on animals and pandas you know

I was thinking about ways to get the environmentalists to be quiet and one would be

you know get a bunch of those pandas and put them down near the launch pad and like get them to

reproduce and everything and then show how you're protecting the environment because you're keeping

endangered species alive near the launch pad not not harming them in any way. So that that was one

kind of weird idea I had as a way to smooth over the tension between them. Anyway thank you.

I'm standing out front of this old Buffalo Wild Wings. It was open, you know, maybe a

month ago, but the poor building is now completely falling apart. So, what was a good, successful

bar is now completely shut down. And now there's graffiti on the side of it, and you can see

it just steadily fall apart. I don't know what the building is going to turn into from

this point forward. What I was out here doing is I was out looking at bars to just apply

for jobs and be a dishwasher at. And this poor Buffalo Wild Wings, I don't know what

caused it to go under, because it seemed like it was doing fine. You know, it was

only open Friday and Saturday nights, I think, but it seemed like it was doing fine, and

then all of a sudden it just went under. So, there's a few sports bars down the way. I've

been going through asking for money and what path that ends me on. Because, you know, the

first step, the easy step I can take is I can just go walk over to that bar over there,

take out an application, turn it in, and work as a dishwasher. But the asking for money

thing puts me on a completely different path, because then I'm on the path of the employer

that wants me the most is the one that shows up, which probably turns into more money in

the long run. So, if I broadcast out and just advertise myself over and over again

to a much larger audience, saying I need money and need work, that should eventually, or

even right off the bat, earn a better living than just walking in and being a dishwasher.

I was going through the education system and career paths and stuff like that. So,

if you're trained and educated in one field and then have to just go work a job to get

by in another, then all that education is null, because it didn't do anything. You ended

up working in a different field. So, making it across that, or which is the best path

to take, is where I'm stuck. Because just being a dishwasher, you know, it's not going

to pay very much, but it will be a job right now. Whereas, if I sit out here and broadcast,

you know, I had a big career in IT and went to five years of college for it, that may

earn a bigger living, but it may, you know, more money, but it may take longer to land

the initial job in the first place. So, I know the longer it takes, the more people

complain about it, and I can't just shoehorn into a dishwasher job and then just be a dishwasher.

And that's the end of it. But it kind of, you know, sacrifices a lot of money when I

was trained for a different field entirely. So, I'm going to keep trying to find the best

path. Anyway, thank you.

I don't know what to do with myself, so I went out and took a walk and

Kind of, you know, to relax a little. I've been laying in bed all day. So, you know, I was out earlier, but then

started laying back down.

I found this empty, boring parking lot. It looks like there's some activity back there, but not much.

I don't know. I'm running out of clip ideas. I was going to go walk down and sit where the migrants are, but

It's too long of a walk. I have one dollar to my name.

So money is, you know, unable to purchase anything.

I could try walking down farther.

It's impossible

get to the right level from the spot I'm in. All I can really do is sit in my hotel room,

try to get

any sort of weird vices or

sleeplessness out of my system, and then be work-ready as soon as I can.

And that's kind of what I'm doing now. I was thinking, you know, because I'm stuck awake all night, every night, I could work the

night shift places, but

that doesn't happen yet.

And I haven't found many

options for that.

Or many options for a night shift job. I know they're around.

The best I could probably do is like security somewhere.

I don't know what else. You know, the bar thing, sort of, although they close at 2.

I don't know what created this up all night

problem I have.

It doesn't go away. And it, you know, I operate in the exact reversal, you know, it's exactly stuck awake at night

trying to sleep during the day, and I have no way to like flip it the other way.

I've tried and tried and tried, and it just doesn't work.

Keeping myself

entertained at night, you know, I'll sit there and play Doom or

try to come up with content ideas, read the news.

Last night, I watched the Chinese space rocket

dock with their space station. I was thinking, you know, Boeing sure could use that thing right now.

They got themselves really stranded on the ISS. So, you know, because they broke ties with the Chinese in 2011,

you know, there's no way to use them for a rescue, but they sure could use it.

Anyway, that's that's the latest on my developments. Thank you.

Once again, uh, woken up in the middle of the night, well not quite the middle of the night tonight,

woken up at 10. Um, all I have to eat are ramen noodles, uh, mixed vegetables and bologna.

And I've been living off ramen noodles, uh, quite a bit for the past four years. Um,

so, uh, ramen, you know, and ever since I was a little kid, yeah, it was ramen noodles morning,

noon and night. So my entire existence has been ramen noodles. I, uh, I have one dollar to my name

and, uh, I don't know what to do. The only thing I can really do is sit out here and, uh,

see what the best, best option is. I can't sleep, you know, might as well walk around to cool down.

I, uh, I bathe a little bit, but that's it. I still have that case of beer sitting in my fridge

from like two and a half weeks ago. I, I don't even touch it anymore.

Oh, and I forgot I do have ice cream sandwiches, but, uh, they are, they, they are really good

unless they're the only food you have. So, uh, I'm going to sit out here and watch the cars go by.

Maybe, uh, maybe some footage will walk right out in front of me. I don't know. There hasn't

been much. I'm on such a small, uh, small little area that, uh, footage is hard to come by. Like,

I keep trying for wildlife. There's foxes, you know, there's five or six foxes I can see out

from the window, but, uh, you know, they're hard to get footage of. And then like I saw a stray cat

and, uh, like six months ago, I saw one possum. So wildlife is sparse, but, uh, uh, you know,

there's gotta be, uh, gotta be some interesting content out here that'll pay the bills, um,

because I have to run on extremely little money constantly. Um, everything is, is, uh,

is the absolute basic of what, what you can function with. So that's, that's making it

more difficult. Anyway, thank you.

What woke me up tonight is a phobia of someone knocking on the door.

I don't know where that came from.

I'm trying to stay out of any problems as much as possible,

so I'm avoiding most interaction with other people.

This knocking on the door phobia is a new one.

I've always been a little startled by it because, I don't know,

I'm from the extreme rural areas,

and people knocking on the door was really rare when I was young.

You know, it just didn't happen.

So I have to get used to being in a world where knocking on the door goes off.

I guess there's someone out there that wants to be out here.

I'm going to walk off the last of the tension I'm going through

and maybe get some food at some point.

Anyway, thank you.

Thank you for the donation. I'm still stuck awake all night and standing out where the cars are.

This is a common spot for people to explain their plight.

I was trying to sleep yet again and I had this weird like

uh kind of wide awake all of a sudden feeling. I kept trying to like you know just force myself

back to sleep and it would just like peg back wide awake. So I'm out walking around again.

It is like the myth now I'm in the middle of the night you know. I think it's like 2 30 or

something. There's a bunch of cars driving around still. I mean this is a really popular intersection

so uh it's uh it's always bustling with activity. But I'm uh I'm nowhere near downtown or

or any of the other really uh really popular spots. This is a more subdued area.

So I uh I'm very appreciative of any donations I receive and uh that money is

is every once in a while it goes to beer but usually it's food or clothing or uh

a bathroom like toothbrush toothpaste. I can't remember. I think I I bought face wash with it

one time. So very uh very appreciative. Thank you.

So I think it's almost 6 a.m. now. I've been awake all night with weird night spells going off.

You know, if I sleep for a little bit I just get woken up like 30 minutes later. So I still,

you know, when I was younger I would play video games late at night. I don't know if that's what

started it. And I just never was able to get it to reset back to normal. But I really, you know,

I keep getting stuck awake all night, every night. And it's so boring that all I can really do

is go outside, walk around, and try to think of video ideas. The benefit of Sunday morning

is it is extremely quiet. You can see there's no traffic whatsoever.

Whereas this is normally a very busy intersection. So, you know, it's kind of interesting seeing

everything completely desolate. I have no transportation so I'm stuck at this one spot.

It's mildly entertaining, you know. I'm just now sitting out here for

for no other reason than to sit out here. I did get a donation in so I have money for

either McDonald's or Walmart in the morning when they start opening. So I'll probably walk

into one of them and get a good meal in at least. But as far as best places to be employed,

because I'm on foot, you know, there's one bar down the way and Walmart, Goodwill,

although I'm a little hesitant about them because, you know, of having such a big party past

in Las Vegas and, you know, all over the place. Working for a bar or hotel or,

you know, any concerts, you know, I used to work for concerts, something in that scene

is probably more suiting because I've just been at it for so long that

the only issue with having no transportation is the only bar within walking distance,

within reasonable walking distance, I should say, is this Mexican restaurant.

And I probably could get a job there, you know. I keep kicking it back and forth. But,

you know, I was raised in like desert western country lifestyle. So it'd be nice, you know,

like Coyote Ugly is here. Be fun to work for them or some of the other bars on 6th Street.

But I have no way to get down there. So, you know, that's kind of new.

And I was looking down on the coast as well in Corpus Christi and,

I don't know, just south of there. And, you know, there's a bar called Rockets in Corpus Christi

that looks fun. It's another one of those night party bars. I know Austin has plenty. They're

just not in the area I'm in. So once I get, you know, all my night trembles out and everything

reset back to normal, I'm probably just going to walk in. Start walking into bars and looking

for jobs there. Everything else seems out of scene for me. I don't know. I'm open to ideas,

you know. Any job ideas I'll jump right on. But as it sits right now, you know, because I'm stuck

all night, every night, just from having too many alcohol-fueled nights in Las Vegas and everywhere,

like I said before, I might as well stick to that because it's easy enough to start as a dishwasher

at a bar and then work up to a bartender. Just tell these same kind of, hopefully,

mildly entertaining stories that I'm saying on here just to barflies as they walk in,

which I could probably do pretty easily. And, you know, it would keep me social, which I enjoy.

I like being social. I don't like being antisocial. It's just you start kind of

gravitating to antisocial behavior unless you work at being social. So I like staying on the

social side of things. Hence, you know, working in a bar somewhere would probably be pretty good.

Have a good time with it. Just wish I had transportation, you know, to get to and from

the thing. So I'm going to keep mulling over ideas. Anyway, thank you.

In lieu of recent events, I haven't been watching the news in a few days, but

in lieu of recent events, you know, I've been making a point about avoiding danger as much

as possible. And that's like where I'm walking, how I'm crossing the street,

what hobbies I'm looking into, stuff like that. And both of my most, my more dangerous hobbies

before were airplanes and motorcycles. Both of them were pretty dangerous. I think

it's really close. I was in a plane crash and a motorcycle crash, and I think the plane crash

was slightly more dangerous, although the motorcycle crash, that one hurt too.

I was on Mulholland Highway in Southern California, and I was going the speed limit

on a Yamaha R1, and a bus, you know, just turned left right in front of me. And I hit on the brakes

and went onto the shoulder trying to avoid it, and then kind of dumped the bike on purpose

just to be able to stop, because I had hit the gravel at that point. And those street tires

aren't very good for gravel. So that was my one and only street motorcycle crash. You know,

I'd been in a lot of dirt bike motorcycle crashes, but only one street motorcycle crash,

and that was it. And at least it was on Mulholland Highway, so it has a good story behind it.

But after that crash, I got a bunch of insurance money for repairs to the bike,

because it was brand new when I bought it. I think it was a 2011 R1, and I got a bunch of

insurance money, so I put different plastics on it and kind of cleaned it back up. It looked

better after the cleanup than it looks stock. I went on eBay and just bought, I can't remember,

like $300 plastics. And then a friend of mine in Van Nuys, California put the plastics on the

bike. I was staying at an RV park there. And he put the plastics on the bike. I went with this

gold and black look, and it was a gold R1 then. And it looked cool. It was just a cool bike.

But once I put the plastics on it, I was too afraid to ride the thing. So it would just sit

there. And then I had to clean up a bunch of my dad's mess in Alaska. I can't remember where I went,

but I left the bike staying at the RV park and went up to Alaska, and then came back down

months later and picked up the bike. Then I took the bike back to Vegas, and it was...

I still hadn't put any miles on it after changing the plastics over, because it was a completely

different like animal then. It went from the Skulls one, which Yamaha only made an R1 in

Skulls in one year, and it just had like demon skulls all over the side of it. That was the

only year they ever did that, and I had that exact one. It didn't look the best out of the other ones,

but it was the cheapest one. So that's why I bought it. But anyway, once the plastics switched over,

it looked a lot better. And looking better made it scarier to ride. I don't know what did that,

but having that golden black, you know, it was really shiny and pretty, and it looked like

one of those bikes you see in Dubai, you know, like you'd ride the thing

along slowly and walk a tiger with it. It just looked like that. So it sat in my backyard for,

I don't know, another six months, and I finally decided it was too scary to ride. So I sold it to

a Colombian woman who had a few other bikes, and it's probably somewhere in Las Vegas now.

I didn't keep tabs on what happened to it after that. It was, I think, my fourth

street bike. I had a Nighthawk 750, a Kawasaki 636, DRZ 400 Black Widow.

I think those were all my street bikes, and the DRZ, that was a dual sport, but I would put the

street tires on it and ride it around on the street. So it was also, you know, it had a license plate

license plate insurance and everything, but that R1 was by far the fastest

you could go on two wheels that I'd ever ridden. I know Hayabusa's are faster in it,

and probably the ZX-14, and I don't know what else.

Depending on the year, you know, some of the other leader bikes will go by,

but Yamaha has always been my favorite because I started out in music as a little kid,

and I don't know what started the music because I had a Yamaha dirt bike as a little kid,

and then I got into music. So I don't know if the Yamaha dirt bike started the music or the music

started the Yamaha dirt bike, but because they make musical instruments on top of motorcycles

and ATVs and all of that stuff, and boats, I always like Yamaha more than the others.

As far as that R1, you know, going back to avoiding danger, it's so dangerous to ride

a motorcycle right now on the street because, you know, just as I was saying before, you got

4,000 pound cars potentially running the red light or turning or doing whatever, and trying

to dance through on a motorcycle gets dangerous quickly. Now in some like rural areas, you know,

where the streets are really quiet, you aren't putting yourself in nearly as much danger,

but in this city stuff, sitting on one of those bikes in traffic is dangerous to say the least.

That's part of the reason or most of the reason I gave up on the bike.

It's benefits were, you know, you could have an absolute ball with the thing.

Like it was so much fun to cruise along on that bike and just not have a care in the world.

But, you know, the danger is kind of what caused it to fail. And speaking of danger, you know,

going through this Donald Trump assassination attempt, and I didn't even watch the video,

but he is not avoiding danger at all. You know, he went from 34 felonies, convicted felonies,

and if it were me in his position, I would have just turned myself in

and gone through the full judicial process. Instead, he chose to keep going for it,

and then next thing you know, he got shot. And you can see this without all the politics and fame and

people watching in one of these little gangster circles. They'll do the same thing.

You'll have one guy come in there and start stealing everything and then trying to be

nice to everyone or trying to act nice and then turning on him. And then he gets himself

either injured or shot or in so much danger he can't get out of it. And then he starts whining

to everyone else to help him, you know, get out of the situation he created. So if I apply that

on the big scale, I'm sticking with my avoid Donald Trump, you know, at all costs. I'm sticking

with that. I don't want anything to do with him. I don't particularly want Biden either because

he's getting old, but Kamala Harris, you know, I'm still going with Kamala Harris as my president

pick for 2024, 2025, whenever they get elected. But he is not avoiding danger

correctly. So I'm going to stick to what I'm doing, which is out here giving my little speeches

and finding the best path to take. Anyway, thank you.

I have this they're all after me paranoia going off and I don't know what's causing it.

I'm thinking you know if I filter what I look at on Instagram and TikTok you know just just look at

like like I was watching rodeo videos and I don't know motorcycle videos I was watching r1 videos

and stuff like that as long as I don't look at the pretty girls that are on there

the drama seems to go away and the the tension seems to go away you know that's what's causing

it being from Nevada having being from you know casinos and and brothels are legal there

and all of that stuff and like knowing the environment anywhere you see those types of

pretty girls is where all the stuff starts to go down and just not looking at them in the first

place seems to be the best option you know if you don't look at them then you don't have some guy

after you mad because you're looking at his girl so I'm trying to avoid like all the all the

the women videos on TikTok and Instagram just to stay out of it I'm I'm single now but not really

in a position to to be in the dating scene as you can see as I have no money whatsoever and I'm

standing on the the side of the road in a common begging spot well I should say I do have some money

I have I got 260 bucks from TikTok and then another I don't know 60 from from donations

so the TikTok money just came in and I was able to get food during that period where I didn't have

any money so thank you again for the donations but you know that puts me at $320 total

not really in a position to be able to provide I was looking at bartending jobs

I don't know which path to take every single one seems to put me in a different situation

so you know I have to sit here and wait for the nights to clear you know so I have clean

sleepful restful nights and then figure out which path I want to take once that happens

tonight you know it was it was rodeo you know like giant bulls riding giant bulls is all that

that I was watching videos of so that's that's what I feel like I'm going through is is these

what being one of these bull riders in the middle of the night just getting thrashed around

and trying to smooth the thing over as quickly as possible with whoever's upset you know I'm

not trying to make any enemies with anyone so whoever's upset you know you got the wrong guy

uh I'm uh I'm not I'm not starting fights but I uh I'm probably gonna walk around uh

tonight and just try to cool off and clear my head and stay out of whatever fights are

starting on social media and in person so anyway thank you

I can't think of much to say, you know, I'm pretty stuck on the side of the road over here.

I can't really do much or go anywhere or do anything.

Like I was saying before, you know, trying to stay out of any confrontation as much as possible.

And trying to stay on the police's side of everything.

So whatever the disagreement or issue is, I'm siding with the police on it.

I'm trying, you know, as I've said before, I've never been arrested.

So I'm trying to keep it that way.

And it's pretty difficult from this position to not be in violation.

You know, every little thing is a violation.

So I'm trying to maintain like no criminal history.

And that makes it difficult to get anywhere from this position.

Because I think at the level I'm sitting at, you know, everyone's like half criminal.

I don't know, you know, I'm not going around asking anyone what they're doing.

But from the spot I'm sitting in, you know, it seems like everyone is either up to something

or recently committed a crime or is about to commit a crime.

So I have to like dodge through the entire time and not get involved with anyone

to be able to make it to, you know, like a normal, law-abiding, working American.

Which, you know, you can see with some of the people out here how difficult it is to pull it off.

Because, you know, you have to operate on such little resources to be able to succeed.

Everything, like every little thing is working against you.

And you have to like, I don't know.

See, part of the reason I haven't made it is it's difficult to climb through.

Hopefully once my face is completely clear, it almost is now, I don't know if it's going to blow back up again.

I have these welts that just form on their own and I'll have a huge blister that just forms

and I have to pull the infection out from underneath it, otherwise it gets worse.

So once that's completely gone, maybe that will shoehorn me into the next like year or bracket or level

and get me on the right path to being an honest worker.

Now, because my past is so undocumented, I have to go back and tell stories about it.

And, you know, I had I guess four or five houses in Nevada and I don't know how many cars.

A bunch of cars, a bunch of motorcycles.

And the whole thing caved in simultaneously where I just had to kind of run for it

because everything started collapsing.

And once the first leg of it went down, which was my dad's cattle ranch getting sold,

arguably forcibly, once that went down, the rest of it kind of caved in with it

because, you know, my entire social circle and all my friends and everything was based on my dad having a cattle ranch.

And once he didn't have that cattle ranch anymore, the whole thing kind of caved in.

I don't know if there was a better way to try to recover it.

I was more concerned about my personal safety than chasing after stolen possessions.

So I just left, informed the police and left.

And that's what started me in this position because nothing ever came from it.

I never received word back on any stolen belongings or any fraud that was committed.

It just all just vanished at once.

So I had to give up and start begging on the side of the road to stay alive.

And that's what's got me to the position I'm in now,

where I'm almost just workable in a completely different city far away from everything that happened.

I don't know if that's the best solution.

You know, you could try to go back through Nevada and comb the whole thing

and see what crimes were committed and see if anything's prosecutable.

And then that would recover some of my gigantic estate that disappeared.

But I mostly gave up on it because I contacted so many police departments to no avail

that now it's just gotten to the point where anywhere I can get a job is where I'll be.

If anyone has any better ideas, I'm all ears.

Anyway, thank you.

I'm out of food and money once again. I thought I was getting a TikTok monthly paycheck on the 15th

and it's the 17th now and I still haven't seen it. I'm still technically under the category of

just begging for donations because I haven't been able to find another income source

and TikTok has been doing pretty well. I'm at the cardboard sign spot now just walking back and

forth because I don't know what else to do. With the last donations I received, I don't know,

got McDonald's, Taco Bell, and Vape. So it wasn't much but the food was really good.

So I'm gonna walk back and forth up here and decide what to do. I'm still half trying to

get this system working because it seems to be beneficial. There's two ways to do this.

You can make a cardboard sign that just says anything helps or lost my job, out of work,

all that stuff. But all you get through is that one little sentence. That's the whole message.

Whereas with this thing, you know, you can give a speech

on why you're in this situation, what led to this situation, and

what you're trying to do to overcome the situation. So theoretically this is the better of the two

but it's a much more complex way to get donations. It seems to be going pretty well

but it doesn't bring in that much money. It's still like 20 bucks a year.

Sometimes you only think I got 60 last time and I try to make it last as long as possible

but I'm still kind of stuck in this spot of having to hustle for donations

to have any spending money to buy food with. So I'm gonna walk around out here for a little bit

and go back. Anyway, thank you!

One of my old business ventures that didn't quite pay off, I'm still hoping it does,

but never did, was lithium-ion batteries. When lithium-ion first became a thing

in like 1998, 1999, laptops started switching over to lithium-ion and it was a considerably

better battery source. I remember the Honda Insight was an electric car or hybrid car that

was just released and it was still running on nickel metal hydride batteries and those just

weren't as good. So I knew lithium was probably going to go up in price and being from Nevada,

um, the prospector capital of the world, uh, you know, any sort of precious metal you kind of

take note of. And in my case it was lithium. I started eyeing lithium and while going to college,

you know, I became interested in it and my mom then said she wanted a ranch again

and there was a lithium, uh, mine in central Nevada called Silver Peak or, uh,

I can't remember what the other name for it is, but Silver Peak, Nevada is where it is.

And, uh, there was a a good-sized property nearby, 316 acres, that was just the land,

uh, that was for sale for like, I can't remember, $600 an acre or something, incredibly cheap.

Um, so, uh, she said she wanted a ranch and there were a few to choose from. I told her to go with

that one and she bought it and we owned it for like 15 years but, uh, then had a fight out there

and had to give up on the thing. I had to leave all my stuff behind and just kind of run for it

and then she sold the place and kept the money from it. But I did get a lot of experience, um,

in that area while being out there for so long. I mean, I had dune buggies and dirt bikes and,

and, uh, all sorts of four-wheel drive trucks getting around the extreme rural Nevada desert

and now with global warming and, and, uh, all the, uh, all the electric car transition

and oil reserves running out, you know, there's only so much oil left in the ground,

lithium still seems, you know, it's still tempting right now, uh, getting, and all I

did then was I was just trying to get close to where the mine was, you know, I wasn't,

I wasn't trying to like, uh, take over or, uh, or start my own operation or anything,

just be near where it was and learn about, uh, lithium ion, lithium mining. Um, so I'm pretty

sure that thing's still running out there. Uh, everything is becoming more and more dependent on

these batteries and they, they do, uh, operate on lithium. So, uh, I just saw, you know, that

Chinese, uh, Chinese rocket, uh, ship capsule, they just switched the batteries in it from nickel

metal hydrate or nickel metal cadmium to lithium ion. And that just happened their last launch.

So companies are still making the transition to lithium ion batteries, which means, you know,

more needs to be dug out of the ground and it'll, it'll also increase, uh, uh, you know, the value

per ounce, you know, in gold and silver, you know, how much is it worth per ounce? Uh, so,

you know, increase the value of lithium per ounce. But, uh, I had to give up on that place.

Part of the reason was I, uh, I was working at, as event security at Boise State University.

And, uh, uh, that got me all swept up in schooling and schools and where nice schools were, you know,

in the event I ever got married, um, you know, I wanted there to be nice schools nearby.

And that was big, that was a big discouragement for Dyer, which is where the apartment was,

Dyer, Nevada, um, because there weren't any schools nearby. So in the event I got married

and had kids, uh, it was not the best place to raise children. Um, it it's way out there.

And like, I think they'd have to ride the bus like two hours to, uh, to Tonopah cause that's

the nearest school. So, uh, uh, it's, uh, it's not the best place to start a family.

And because at this time, this was before everything cascaded on me and I couldn't dig

myself out. But at that time, um, uh, I was like 30, 34, uh, I don't know, maybe 35.

Um, so, and I was working for Boise state, so I was trying to get everything situated for that

purpose, but the whole thing caved in on me and I just gave up at it. And that's when I, I became

homeless. Well, I ran out of money and then became homeless and was homeless for three years.

So, uh, had to get, just dump the entire thing and give up. But, uh, you know, the only money

I can see out of it now, which is all, you know, I need money now. Um, the only money I can see

out of it now is explaining how to operate in that environment. Like how to, uh, uh, haul water

and you know, what type of tires to put on cars that, that don't get stuck in the, uh, the powder

because there's this really fine powder dust out there. And then, you know, all the, uh,

all the ways to interact with the, the people that live out there so it doesn't upset everyone.

So I know all that pretty well, but you know, I had to abandon the house. So, uh, uh, it's kind of,

you know, uh, annoying that, uh, that I never actually saw any money out of 15 years of,

15 years of, of work out there. Um, and it was the 15 years of work was that, that land was

purchased, um, just as basic, you know, there was nothing on it. It had a bunch of trees and a well

and a kind of pokey fence line. And that's all that was there. So after all of that, you know,

then there were two houses, two garages, um, a bunch of fence repairs. Uh, I don't know,

that might've been all that was actually done, but you know, it was considerable building two

houses on a, on a, on a property that's way out in the middle of nowhere is, uh, is work. And

it was working in conjunction with my mom. You know, I would only spend a few days out there

usually. And then she would, she was trying to live out there full time. Um, so, uh, uh,

you know, I would, I think the longest I would stay out there is two weeks,

but, uh, she ended up keeping the house and all my belongings and, and sold it and kept all the

money. Uh, so it was, it was a rough exit out of that thing. Anyway. Thank you.

While being without money, I do have a hotel room paid for.

It's just a monthly stay, one in North Austin.

But here's a little tour of the thing.

It's nothing spectacular, really small,

but I'm content with small hotel rooms

because it is the most wonderful place to be

when you're coming from not having a place at all.

So no complaints on my end.

But, you know, I don't have any cash whatsoever.

So I have to, that's why you see me hustling on here

for spending money, because I never have any money.

I was looking at jobs.

You know, like I said before,

I worked at Boise State University

as event security event staff.

And because there's a big university here in Austin,

University of Texas at Austin,

I might be able to get my foot in the door there

just from past experience working in the university system.

It's a good place to be.

I really like working for schools.

The whole reason I took that job in the first place

in Boise was to get my foot in the door

in the university system.

And having a bigger, more beautiful school here in Austin

is really tempting.

Tempting to the point that, you know,

I'm already browsing jobs on there.

I was saying I was going to work as a bartender

and just start as a dishwasher

and then work my way up in a restaurant somewhere.

But if this university system, you know,

if I can get my foot in the door in the university system,

I'll start heading in that direction.

Because it's just a better career path.

And I have, you know, I went to college for five years.

I didn't graduate from anything.

I went to DeVry for two years

and then went to community colleges

for another three years after that.

But this was without graduating, you know,

I would just take classes for no reason.

Well, I would take classes

in the information technology field

and then wouldn't be able to pass the final

for one reason or another.

But I got the experience out of it

because I was running a small IT business.

So I was just taking the classes

to know how to repair

some of the stuff I was trying to repair.

And so getting the certification at the end

wasn't really the big issue or the big deal about it.

Looking back, I wish I put a little more effort into it,

but at that time I was just getting the knowledge out of it

so I could get a small business going.

Now, you know, a bunch of those credits

would probably transfer to the university system.

So I could take classes at University of Texas,

which would be cool.

I don't know, because I got so swept up

in social media and film production now

that I would probably take

the film production side of things

instead of the technician side of things

as I did the first time.

In the late 90s, early 2000s,

you know, computers were brand new,

cell phones were these big bricks

that didn't have any text messaging or screens or anything.

You just dial the phone number and that was it.

So the technician side of things was more profitable.

Now, because everything has a camera on it,

on the film production side

seems to be the more profitable side.

So I would switch all that over to film production

and keep going from there.

But I'm gonna try to make it down to University of Texas

and see the campus and see what jobs are available.

I've been down there before,

but I just walked through briefly.

It wasn't anything that big.

So I'm gonna give it another look

and see if I can get my foot in the door.

Anyway, thank you.

So my latest issue is I changed my main email address on my PayPal account to a Gmail account

so all my email goes to my Gmail account. Well, I forgot to update that on my TikTok account

and now the monthly payment I was supposed to receive from TikTok disappeared. It went to my

old PayPal email address not the new PayPal email address. So that was like $263 I can't seem to

recover. And I filed a claim with the help desk and I updated the email to the new email address

probably two days on the 17th. So it's supposed to come in on the 15th. I updated on the 17th.

Well, I haven't received a response at all. I don't know if it's supposed to come in now

on the next month. But, you know, I'm constantly straining for money and that really would have

helped. I have been using it to buy food primarily. I bought a belt. You know, it's the

little things I need like Neutrogena for my face and shampoo and I don't know what else.

Just normal food from Walmart on top of that. So that's what I'm using that money for.

For that $263 to kind of disappear on me is pretty annoying. I don't know who to contact at TikTok

to get it recovered because this is the first time this has happened. You know,

I've been receiving pay the entire time and have been receiving the monthly paychecks

every month without issue. This is the first month I haven't been able to receive it.

And usually, you know, I think the lowest was I got $50 in one time and the highest

was like $600 or something when I had a really good video. But this month was $263

and I really would have used it. So I don't know what to do, who to contact at TikTok to get that

money transferred over to my PayPal, but it still hasn't arrived. So anyway, thank you.

So I went around all different types of places on the computer and came to the conclusion that

I'm pretty content staying in Austin. You know, if it's really up to me,

staying put in Austin is where I like to be. I have an extensive driving history.

I've had so many cars and I've driven, you know, I've probably driven a million miles.

A lot of driving. Never been in an at-fault accident. The only accident I've ever been in

that was in a car was someone bumped into my rear bumper while I was saying at stop light.

It didn't do any damage to the car, but I've driven everywhere. You know, I've been from

Key West in Florida all the way up to Prudhoe Bay, Alaska in North Slope, Alaska, which is the

most northern point in Alaska, and Key West, Florida is the most southern point in the United

States. So that was the range of my driving. I think I've been to like 48 of the 50 states,

you know, like Delaware for some reason. I think there was a toll to get into Delaware,

so I never went there. Maybe Rhode Island, I don't know. A few of the little ones,

but been to all the major states. So I've driven a lot and that's also caused a problem with my

like driving habits because I will just freewheel in a car anywhere. I can coast along in a car

for like 10 hours a day and just be on the other side of the country without thinking about it.

So I have to be really careful because I'm completely like alone, you know,

no family, no friends. You know, I wandered around too long, I think. Because of that,

my freewheeling ability is just, you know, out of control. So the second I get a car, you know,

I'm suddenly like I want to go to the beach or I want to go watch a space launch

and I'll just end up driving around all over the place sleeping in the back of the car.

So I have to be really careful about it. I'm waiting for, you know, to get myself bracketed

enough to be stable and part of a community and all that stuff. And I really like being in Austin,

but I'll catch myself doing it now. I was, like I was saying before, you know, fleeing the country

and going down to Columbia to hide out. I started thinking, well, is it possible to drive to

Columbia and how difficult it would be to drive down there and what an adventure it would be

to drive it. So that's what keeps happening. And then, you know, like I'll want to go see a Dallas

Cowboys football game and then I'll want to be all the way over there. And now I want to go see

the Starship launch. So I'll go down over there. So my, you know, it's all over the place,

like my thought process on where to be. I'm still trying to get that smoothed over,

cleaned up or bracketed or however you want to describe it so that, you know, I can, you know,

earn a living for one thing because that doesn't really make any money. It costs money. It doesn't

make money. And be a beneficial part of society, which driving around aimlessly doesn't really

help. So that said, you know, I have a really strong driving history. It's just putting it

to good use instead of wandering around everywhere is the difficult part. So Austin, you know,

Austin's my favorite currently. I don't particularly want to be anywhere else,

but I get inspired to go places all the time and have to be careful about it. So anyway, thank you.

So I'm in a position where I can't really do anything.

I'm stuck in this one spot with,

I think I have $44 and thank you for the donations. By the way,

they're going to McDonald's and Walmart.

And so they're mostly going to food. I may, you know,

I may get some more Neutrogena and shampoo and toothbrush,

toothpaste, you know, simple stuff like that. That's what they're going to.

But I am very appreciative of the donations.

So I'm kind of stuck in this one spot.

I'm trying to get my sleep cycle a little more stable

because it's kind of all over the place and I'm getting closer to being

able to sleep at night correctly, but it's still a little off. You know,

I still get woken up at, at, you know, 4 a.m. with some, you know,

sweating and with some sort of night tremor that I'll have to go walk out.

So I'm trying to get through the last of that.

I haven't had a cigarette in quite a while. I'm just vaping now.

I'm trying to switch the vape over to just chewing gum.

I have beer in my fridge. I think I had two beers yesterday,

but I hadn't had beer in a few weeks before that.

So that's the extent of my bad habits. I,

I'm browsing around everywhere for work in the United States and outside of the

United States, you know, whoever's paying. So, you know, bartending,

working at the university, working concerts, working football games.

There's, there's options presenting themselves.

I think bartender is in first just because I like talking so much that you

it would be fun to be a bartender and just to get to socialize with butterflies

all day. So I'm, I'm looking around at bars all over the place.

I know the university would be a better career path,

but I can't land very high up on the totem pole.

And if I start out as a dishwasher or bartender,

I can climb up that and,

and then work my way up into the university system.

So it may take some time getting to that level. Because, you know,

I was in it before and because the field like has, you know,

there's much less employers than before. These,

these devices run on their own now, so you don't need to repair them very much.

And that kind of put the, the it field out on, you know,

on the back burner until some new technology comes along.

No one can figure out it's on the back burner.

So I'm looking at these other possibilities, you know,

this content creator thing, if I could turn enough of a profit with it,

I would do it. And you know,

all sorts of retail, although retail is not going very well either. You know,

I'm watching these retail stores closed down all over the place.

The only one that seems to be doing well is Walmart.

Walmart is doing really well, but the others, you know,

I'm watching them close down or have very few customers.

Everyone's switching to online shopping. So,

I'm not going to put too much effort into it. So like I said before,

I think bartenders is in first place currently.

I've been going back through university experience I've had and most of it has been

Boise State University, which was just working event staff,

event security for concerts and basketball games.

And that's the event, that's the extent of my university experience. But my IT field,

the reason I went in there in the first place was to try to start to transfer my credits over from

DeVry University, which is just an IT school, to an actual university. So I was trying to

work there and then go to college at the same time. And this was when I was like 34.

I'm 42 now, so I'm running long in the tooth on this thing. But I still can transfer that

experience over to potentially the University of Texas at Austin, the Longhorns University,

and maybe get somewhere there. I don't know. Because I don't have transportation,

I have no way to get down there. I can ride the bus, but it takes so long to get down there,

you know, I run out of gas by the time I get there. So the bus isn't working quite as well as

I'd hoped. I keep browsing the website they have, looking at what job opportunities are there.

Because I just did event staff the first time, I don't know how far up I'd get

trying to work there. Like, I'm doing these little content videos online,

but I don't know how good of a lecture I can give and what it would be about.

You know, I could do lectures about IT, I could do lectures about homelessness, poverty,

environmentalism, aerospace, you know, because my dad had a background in aviation and I did a lot

of research on space. I have some knowledge of aerospace as well. You know, lithium-ion batteries,

everything I was going on about batteries, I can give lectures about that.

So those are the fields I have some knowledge in,

but I'm jammed in such a weird gear that I can't really do anything. You know, I can't make it down

there and I can't get my sleep cycle set correctly so I'm awake at the right time of the day to be

there. Like, today's another day where I just slept all day again and I don't know if I'm going

to get stuck awake tonight or be able to sleep. I think I'm catching up on my sleep from like 20

years of sleep deficiency, which is what caused my sporadic sleep cycles to begin with. So I'm

going to keep browsing online and see if a door opens up for me that I can actually become somewhat

accomplished. So anyway, thank you.

So I'm out of food, money, and beer. I've been, I think I got 40 or 50 bucks in over the past week

or so, and I've been steadily using it to buy McDonald's. For some reason, when I get donated

money in, I can't walk over to Walmart. I can only go to McDonald's with it. So I've been eating

McDonald's. As you can see, you know, my fridge is completely empty of food except for that soda.

I had a case of beer in there, but I finally went through the last two beers

last night, I think. So this is the scary part of this whole situation,

is I appear to have to go bankrupt and then have to ask for money to get to the next gear,

which is just being able to ask for money safely so I can become employable.

Because without having the ability to ask for money, there's no point to it all. You know,

you just work as a drone. You have to be able to ask for an income for whatever you're doing.

So I'm stuck in this spot, and I keep going bankrupt, and it gets, it's scary every time

because you don't know if you're going to get food. And I didn't receive my TikTok paycheck

this month, so that would have been another $262 that didn't show up, all because I updated my

email address to a Gmail email address, so all my email accounts were the same. I was using my old

email for PayPal, and apparently that creates like hidden emails, and no one, you can't have hidden

emails because that starts an investigation. So I had to uniform all my accounts under one email

account, and it didn't update on my TikTok, and the money disappeared. You know, that's a

disappeared paycheck that I have no way to receive. So I'm sitting, you know, I have $1 in my wallet

and no way to buy food. It's difficult. If there's a smoother way through this,

I'm all ears, but it appears to be I just have to ask for money over and over again

until I'm in the right position where the right employer offers me money to do a job.

So anyway, thank you.

I'm looking at where I should be and where I'd be the most productive and the, you know,

happiest, healthiest, and most potential to be married with children and all the normal

family stuff. And I've been browsing around all over the place. Now, just a few years ago,

I was driving a Ford E350 van around just kind of randomly, you know, wherever I ended up.

And when you drive one of those, you kind of half think, you know, where's a good place to start a

family? And you go through that whole spiel. Well, that Ford ended up giving out, you know,

my tags expired and I happened to be in this town called Mims, Florida, which is just outside of

Kennedy Space Center. And at that time, I had like too many airplanes in my head is the best way to

describe it. You know, I was trying to stay away from aviation. So, I just needed a spot to anchor

down and not have to move around. And, you know, the way those things think, you know, you're always

kind of getting blown around by something if you think about airplanes too much. It's just getting

blown around. So, in Florida, because there's so much nature and so much environment and trees and

wildlife and everything that you can just sit out in the forest, tropical forest, I guess, and

sit out there and just kind of detox yourself of any sort of motion or moving around because

there's so much nature to just anchor yourself down with. So, it was a really good spot to

completely distance myself from aviation. The other benefit of it was all of the like animal

and momentum and kind of engineering that was all like bottled up in my thought process

kind of probably just piled into Kennedy Space Center. And then, you know, if you think of it

that way, then all that momentum just goes up into space, which seems to be more productive than

flying around in circles over and over again. Because people have already flown all over the

planet, you know, it doesn't really seem to get us anywhere at this point, flying back and forth

between places. Now, space, on the other hand, is considerably more interesting and we've never been

there before. So, you know, it's a new thing. So, I thought, you know, just let it all be near

Kennedy Space Center and maybe someone can come along and build a rocket out of it. So, that's why

I was there in the first place. When I was in an E350 Ford van, that ended up getting towed at

McDonald's in Men's Florida and I had to walk around there for like, I don't know, a year, year and a

half, just trying to burn off that cigarette addiction that I've mentioned on here a million

times, which I have mostly burned off now. It's another way to just avoid being in an aircraft

of any kind, is just have something else to just brainwash it out of you so you don't go near them.

And that's what I was trying to do. I didn't mean for my cigarette addiction to get as bad as it

did. I mostly have it down to vape and chewing gum now. Well, it is down to vape and chewing gum now.

And I'm trying to reduce the vape down to just chewing gum, but not quite there yet. So, that's

the last of it. But being near Kennedy Space Center gives you a lot of potential for the future

because, you know, there's more rocket launches every day. This whole industry is getting built

up considerably. So, part of my motivation was just kind of hustling my way nearby, you know.

You just sit nearby and kind of hustle, which I was doing with a sheet of cardboard, until you get

into the community. And now I'm going through how much community, you know, I didn't make any money

but I earned community, if that makes any sense. And there's a lot of cheap land in that area.

Like, this is Mims, Florida. 1.27 acres for $50,000. And it's in a normal residential area.

So, it's not incredibly expensive to be there. And the potential for the future is considerable, you know.

If space keeps going the way it's going, you know, that's going to be a huge development area.

Because it's the launch pad that has worked. The only issue I have with Kennedy Space Center,

in general, is it seems to, like, try to go to the moon too much. And I went through this huge

philosophical kind of saga when I was sleeping in the brush near Kennedy Space Center about,

you know, if you build a rocket, where's the best place to go with it? And I came to the conclusion

that just not going to the moon at all was the best option. Because, you know, the second you

start landing junk on the thing, or firing thrusters on it, or having any sort of orbit around it,

you're adjusting its orbit around the earth. So now you have a different, you know, the moon has a

different path around the earth. And that can affect, you know, the climate, weather, the

tidal forces and tidal friction of the earth, which can, you know, that could do lasting damage

to the planet if you move the moon enough to adjust the climate considerably, or adjust

tidal forces. You know, you can heat and cool the earth with where the moon is positioned orbiting

around it. If you put the moon farther away, I think the earth would be cooler. If you put the moon

closer to orbiting the planet, then the earth gets warmer. So anyway, thank you.

I am dealing with the definition of an unsecure wireless network.

So it looks like anything that operates on Android or Chrome OS, this screen cast goes off

and your screen can be casted to anyone on the wireless network.

So someone has exploited this and has now connected to my laptop.

I don't know. I guess they can see the whole screen.

I'm all ears on how to turn that off. I've tried disabling

the setting in the Chrome OS registry thing to get it to stop doing that, but it didn't seem

to help. It's still casting my screen somewhere. And does that mean they can see anything that's

on the screen? So anything I click on goes to whoever that is.

It seems like a pretty big security hole to exploit.

And I don't know if Windows has the same problem,

but it'll just go off randomly that I'm casting to someone else's screen.

And the person on the other side of this thing, what are they thinking?

It seems like that would be incredibly illegal to connect to someone's computer remotely.

I don't know what steps to take. This wireless network at this hotel has been

problematic. It gets intermittent sometimes, and because every... I think it's wide open,

so anything that's on the local network can connect to anything on the local network.

So anyone that connects to the thing can view the other devices on the network.

I have worked on business networks before, but I don't know how much it would take to fix this.

You would have to subnet it out to have each individual computer on a different subnet,

and then it wouldn't be the same local area network across all of them.

So they wouldn't be able to connect to each other. But this is a glaring issue.

So I just give up on this laptop half the time and just shut the thing down,

because that creates so much paranoia just not knowing I have my PayPal on there, I have my cash

app, and having them able to connect to it. There's no money in either one of them.

Once again, I think I have $5 in my PayPal, and that's it. So there's no money in them,

but even still, being able to connect to the screen, then they can connect to the passwords

maybe, or view the passwords potentially, and log into my PayPal and just drain the account.

So I don't know how to track it down too well. I've contacted the network operators in this hotel

over other issues, over intermittent reliability issues, but I haven't contacted them about the

screencasting thing, because they'll probably just say it's an issue with the laptop and not

an issue with their network, which is questionable, because it being wide open means any device can

connect to any other device and share files, view content, stuff like view the screen,

as I just showed you. So I can barely even use my laptop on this network. I have to shut down

every time that starts connecting to whoever's doing that. And I'll see it show up on my cell

phone that so-and-so's device is on the network, and do I want to connect to it or not, and I click

cancel every time. But I can see how you could accidentally click the other option, and then

just be connecting to their device over and over again. So I hope, you know, in the future, you'd

think by now these issues would be resolved, because we've been building these computers for

30 years. You'd think by now these issues would be resolved, but nope, here we are still going with

with what is claimed to be an extremely secure operating system having that big of a vulnerability.

So I'll just be using the cell phone mostly because the poor laptop, you know,

people keep connecting to the screen to it. So anyway, thank you.

Out of food and money once again. I got donations maybe a week ago which I'm very appreciative of

but ran out of food and money. Here's all I have left is like two beers and a few ice cream

sandwiches and that's all I have. So it's, I zeroed out both my PayPal and Cash App accounts

and just buying food at Walmart and I haven't been buying stuff that expensive. You know,

it's, I think I got like freezer shrimp and that was the most expensive thing. Everything else was

TV dinners and oh I don't know, invitation crab meat, you know, nothing that spectacular.

So I'm trying to get through this jam to the best of my ability but the only way to

make any money right now is just asking on here. So any donations would be appreciated.

I'm going to keep trying to make videos and keep new content coming in. Anyway, thank you.

Thank you for the donations. I got this $5 meal deal from McDonald's which is pretty good I gotta

say. But I only got like I think $25 in and ended up getting a big breakfast this morning and now a

$5 meal deal for the afternoon. I'm going to McDonald's with the donations because it seems

to work with like food control and how you motivate yourself. So what you're motivated by

and if I just motivate myself with McDonald's like just can't wait to go get McDonald's

everything seems to clean up really well. And you know then you know I have simple motivations.

Motivated to go to McDonald's and then motivated when to go to sleep and my whole like schedule

and system all kind of writes itself. So I'm just using McDonald's to straighten everything out.

And when I go to Walmart it's a little more complicated because I have to go buy the food

and then cook the food. So it's not as as instant motivation as McDonald's. So I'm gonna keep going

to McDonald's with the donations. Like I said I think I have $15 left which is you know I'll get

two more meals out of this thing. Because another thing about the $5 meal deal is it's nowhere near

$5. When I get the the large drink you know it's like and and the hot and spicy sandwich it's like

$6.60 for the whole thing. So you know I'm nowhere near a $5 meal deal but it's really good to eat.

So anyway thank you.

Going through more baggage, I've had a few German cars. When I lived in Las Vegas, I had a

E46 BMW M3. I think it was a 2005. And then I had like a 2002 Volkswagen Golf TDI. And so those

were my two German cars. Now for some reason, right now, sitting in Austin, Texas in 2024,

I'm now haunted by a 1960s Opel Kadett. And I don't know, I think my mom may have had an Opel

Kadett when she was really young. And they imported it in Pennsylvania to the United States, and it

had to go through a bunch of legal restrictions. Now, this coming up now is pretty strange.

I don't know why this car is like haunting me, but for some reason, a 1960s Opel Kadett is what's

on my mind. And I've been using that homeless system. You know, you always see homeless people

kind of yelling on the side of the road, and you're wondering, you know, what are they yelling

about? What are they upset about? So I go out there, get in the mindset that they're in, and then just

say whatever I'm thinking. And right now, using that very mechanism, what I'm thinking about is a

1960s Opel Kadett. So I don't know how that thing got buried in my psyche. I never saw it, never

really knew anything about it, other than she had it for a while and then got like a Volkswagen bus

or something. And I have no idea what happened to the car. But it coming up now is strange, to say

the least. And I've been going through every thought I have, and what the best

path to take is, and how to be successful. But getting bogged down by having to think about

old cars from the 1960s is slowing down progress, to say the least. And this Opel Kadett is the worst

one. I don't know if they broke some law importing the car in the United States, because Opel has

never been sold in the United States. It's always been, I think, Germany only, although they

could be selling them in other countries. In the United States, you never see Opel very often.

They rebrand them sometimes, like the Saturn Sky, which was made in the late 2000s,

was an Opel GT that they put different badges on. So that was an Opel that existed in the United

States, legally. But this little Opel Kadett was not. And I don't know if they broke some law, and that's

now flagging some police radar that this car was illegally imported in the United States.

But this is more on the backlog of crime I'm forced to go through. And it's all from

60 years ago. This would be, if it's a 1960, 60 years ago.

And it's coming up now, because no one ever explained their side of the story to anyone. So

who knows what happened with this thing. I think it's more involved with my grandfather's tool

company, and all the weird mechanisms they built out there. That this is more thinking

you're smarter than everyone, and not asking anyone else how to do something, just doing it

on your own. And getting so far off course from the rest of the country, that it turns into weird

systems that don't make any sense. And I think the only thing that was kept out of

that entire tool company, other than haunted memories of this Opel Kadett,

there was a high-low stock market scheme, where you could buy stocks low, and then sell

them high. So you wait for a big company to dip in stock value, and then buy up a bunch of the stock.

And then once the stock rebounds to a better price, you just sell it. And it makes money.

I tried it with CSX, which is a train company that operates out of the east coast.

So I bought up, you know, CSX was down below their average. And that's a really big,

stable company. So they were down below their average. I bought up a bunch of their stock,

and then waited like six months, and it rebounded as it should. And then sold all the stock,

and I made like $10,000 off the thing. So that's how it works. But then you end up with this

weird money that's kind of operating outside of any normal system. So I mostly gave up on that.

You know, it's almost better to not even use it at all. To just, you know, ask for money,

and ask for employment, and just work somewhere. Because that high-low system, you know,

it's always like you're ripping someone off with it. So I gave up on that. It's kind of a stock

market scheme where you just, it feels like you're ripping people off. So I mostly gave up on it. But

you know, if you invest in a company, and then want to see the company succeed,

then it's good to invest in the stock market. If you invest in a company while they're down and

out, and then sell when they rebound, it's kind of exploitive. So I'm staying out of it. I'm going

to stick with this, just asking for money and seeing what donations come in. Speaking of

donations, I got, oh, I don't know, a hundred bucks in yesterday, which was really good.

So thank you very much. I just bought McDonald's so far. You know, I was thinking about getting

new clothing. I could, I have one pair of pants that are functional. So I have one pair of pants

and one set of shoes. And my shoes are construction boots, and my pants are probably contractor pants

would be the best way to describe them. So I was thinking about getting dressier clothing. And you

know, the shirt, I've been wearing this shirt for two and a half years. So I may get some better

clothing with that hair box. So anyway, thank you again.

I've been doing some research on what paths to take and where I've been. I spent a considerable

amount of time in Alaska and I don't want to particularly go back up there, short of maybe

a vacation here and there, but to live, you know, I don't want to be up there that much.

So I kept getting bracketed to drive up there, like I felt like I was getting forced to drive

up there over and over again and it would happen every summer. I don't know if it was

because, you know, my dad worked as a bush pilot during the summers in Alaska and I somehow got

got bracketed into his system where he'd fly up every summer and then fly back in the fall.

I didn't have a pilot's license or a plane or anything so I would end up getting jammed in

that thing and having to drive, like almost controlled to drive up to Alaska through Canada

and, you know, all over Alaska. And I got sick of it by the last time. Last time I was driving a

Ford F-150 and I went all the way up to Prudhoe Bay and then back down to Fairbanks, did that a

few times. Then the truck, I ran out of money and I tried to sell the truck and they just gave me

enough for an airplane ticket and I flew back to Los Angeles and that was the last time I went to

Alaska. But while I was up there, during that trip, I went to the Yukon River and drove by, you know,

I went to multiple places on the Yukon River and then drove by Denali or Mount McKinley.

It used to be called Mount McKinley and then I think Barack Obama changed the name to Denali.

It's the tallest mountain in North America and some people still call it Mount McKinley up there.

I like the Denali name better. I just, it rolls off the tongue better. But I saw that mountain

from the interstate and, or the highway, I guess it's just a highway there, and I went to

Talkeetna, which is where the airplanes take off to go to base camp at the base of the Denali

mountain climb. And so I hung out at the bar there and talked to a few people. So,

both of those, you know, I have been to both the Yukon River and seen Denali but never actually

flew over to base camp and climbed the thing. I just saw it from the road and talked to people

at the bar. So now I'm looking at cars and I'm wondering how important the name of a car is when

you buy it because I wasn't putting any effort into what the name of the car was. It, you know,

just, it was horsepower, miles per gallon, you know, how much it can tow, stuff like that. That's

all I cared about. And I started looking at the names of everything and the one that came up is

this GMC Yukon Denali that they just made a Duramax version for. Like three years ago they made this

three liter Duramax edition of the thing. And it's an SUV. I think it's got three rows of seating.

The last car or last vehicle I had was a 15 passenger Ford E350 van and so it had more

passenger space. But this, this Denali, you know, with eight passengers, I think, is still pretty

good. And it gets like 25 miles per gallon and goes, I don't know, 650 miles to a tank of diesel.

So it's pretty good all in all. And its name, you know, I can bring a lot to the name of that thing

because I've driven through the Yukon territory in Canada multiple times and been to the Yukon

River in Alaska multiple times and multiple places and seen Denali Mountain. So I could

tell that story over and over again or those multiple stories over and over again

while driving the vehicle. But the problem with it is they are really expensive.

Me coming from no money whatsoever, you know, it's really expensive to get into one of

those things. And just to have all my Alaska backstory going into it, I was trying to figure

out is there a better way to do that, to get paid to tell stories. But I haven't found the best

path yet. So I'm going to keep talking into this thing and see what comes out. I also want to say

thank you for the donations. I've been buying McDonald's and the donations have been coming

in steadily. I think I'm sitting at $90, maybe $100. And I'm really appreciative of them. So

anyway, thank you.

I've been putting some Doom clips on my TikTok and Instagram.

I've had Doom 2 when I was 10 or 12,

I think Doom 2 came out.

And at the time we had a Macintosh Performa, I think 768.

It was before Apple was Apple.

Well, actually it started out Apple

and then turned into Macintosh

and that went back to Apple again.

So I had one of the Macintoshes.

And when I was really young, we had Apple 2E and 2C.

So I started out with Apple computers

and then ended up switching

because the video games were better on PC.

But my very first first-person shooter was on an Apple

and it was Doom 2 for Macintosh.

And I carried that over.

About a year ago, I bought Doom 2 for Chrome OS for $5

and played through it a million times,

played through all the add-ons and expansions and everything.

They had a $2 sale on Doom 1

and I'd never played Doom 1 past the shareware version.

And so I spent the $2 of that $100 I got in donations

and spent $2 on Doom 1.

And this is it, I'm at the very last level

of the very last episode of the game.

And I haven't quite beat it yet.

I haven't used any walkthroughs or cheats

or anything out of the box.

So it's my first play through on Doom 1

and made it to the very last level with no walkthrough.

But that's after playing Doom 2 for the past year

because it's the only game I have.

With no money, you can't go around buying video games.

So I've been playing Doom 2 in my off time

for the past year.

And it made Doom 1 extremely easy to play through.

I've had this thing maybe 20 hours now

and I'm on the last level.

So this is on the easiest skill setting.

If I crank up the skill setting,

I won't be able to do as well.

But I've enjoyed Doom and id Software's games

for a very long time.

After having that Macintosh as a kid,

I bought Quake 2, which was the first

really good multiplayer game

that you could play online against other people.

And it had just good multiplayer team deathmatch

and free for all and capture the flag

and all sorts of things.

That was also from id Software

and it was a good chunk of my childhood.

So both Doom and Quake, I played a lot as a child

and it's pretty comforting to have them now.

It's just good memories.

But the behemoth that is Doom,

I was doing research on how many game copies

this thing sold and it outsold everyone in the 90s.

And it's still selling now.

I bought it now for $2.

So it's still making money.

Whereas Quake has all but disappeared.

I noticed it wasn't available on Chrome OS

and I don't know if they're selling the boxes anywhere.

I doubt it.

But Doom is still going strong.

So I'm having a ball with Doom.

I'm hoping, you know, my only complaint

is there's no way to add the third party wads to the thing

which are the third party expansion levels

and modifications for it.

And in Chrome OS, I cannot find where to put the wad file,

what folder to put it in.

So I finally gave up and I just stuck with the stock setup

which they do release expansions for it.

I mean, they released Sigil like six months ago

or Sigil 2 six months ago.

And it took six months to get another expansion

which is amazing.

I gotta give them credit.

The latest expansion they put out for the thing

is called Tetanus and it is as good

if not the best expansion they've put out.

And it was just made in 2023.

So they're still making expansions for this thing.

It's going strong.

I'm having a ball with it in my off time

just playing through these old levels.

This poor laptop only has a Celeron N something, 4020.

I don't know.

I can't remember, but it's a really slow processor.

Now for Doom, it does great,

but any other games that it can't play very well.

So this is about my max gaming ability on this system.

I hope, they're making another Doom.

They made Doom Eternal

and I think they're making another one on top of that.

So I hope software keeps going strong.

They've always been one of my favorite

if not my favorite game developer.

Absolutely at the top of the list.

They have a huge convention in Dallas every year.

I'm in Austin, but they have a huge convention

in Dallas every year called QuakeCon

and everyone drags their computers

and it's the old LAN party system.

So everyone drags their computers there

and they play video games for like three days or something

and have giveaways and tournaments and stuff like that.

So it's been a good event for 30 years

and I hope they keep going strong.

Anyway, thank you.

Out walking around looking for career ideas and you know because I did IT for so long

and now the social media thing, I'm browsing around companies that need

content creators. I don't know how good I am. I'm still learning as I go

because everything seems to be mostly repaired. The IT repair side is mostly gone

but the content creation is still going. So you know getting a crash course in film school

is what I'm getting out of this thing and maybe it'll help

with you know just advertising which is all I'm really looking at it for.

I'm just working in advertising and how to make commercials and promote a product because I

worked in sales as well. It was mostly for retail but I worked in sales for Circuit City and Office

Depot and Target and Lowe's. So I have some sales experience as well and just pushing a

product or service is what content creation seems to be. At least that seems to be where the money

is but needing a product to sell is where I am. I don't know if this little page you know if I can

advertise products on here and just sell them you know. I was thinking about stuff that could

be sold on here and it would be things like outdoor backpacks and I don't know hiking boots.

All the outdoorsy stuff that kind of carried me through when I was homeless and

and wandering around on the street. The stuff I was using to stay alive and I could probably

sell some of that stuff. You know tents as well because I was in I had four or five tents total

when I was in Florida. So tents also were a big part of my survival. So that those would be

things I could sell. Now I don't know how to get in contact with the companies that

need advertisers. It still comes through as me just hustling for something that no one wants

to pay for. So I'm kind of grinding through everything and seeing what the best path is

or which company to try and hustle for for employment. But I'm gonna keep browsing around

online and just telling my story on here and see what comes through. Anyway thank you.

So I'm going through what I could sell with this thing and uh you know I'm open to ideas. I uh

I have a few followers on TikTok. Instagram's not going quite as well. Part of the problem

with Instagram is you can only upload a minute and a half long video and that's I guess the max time

limit. Whereas TikTok is 10 minutes so I like TikTok a lot more. Um but I don't have as big

of a following on Instagram. I just haven't put as much time into it. Anyway speaking of sales you

know it's uh it's a good platform to advertise on but uh you know that gets down to what what do

you want to advertise. Like what what's worth selling and how it how uh it will affect your

your uh personal life with what you're selling. Because if you think about old retail stores um

I've worked a lot of old retail stores and even current retail stores like Walmart for instance

just doing advertising um selling whatever uh uh electronics or or outdoorsy uh gear um

on here and then earning a commission from the sales. That's how the old system used to work.

Um now all the retail stores run on hourly so they don't use that commission system.

But uh that commission system sure was motivating to uh to make sales. So applying that over to

social media um if you run it on a commission system uh you end up getting a lot more sales

but a lot more aggressive sales for people. So I don't know how well that would carry over.

Um it uh it it's a way to get people to buy things really quickly but uh it's also you you hurt

return business with it because the uh commission-based salesman becomes so aggressive trying

to sell whatever they're selling that they end up running off the customers. So uh as far as

payment goes you know I don't know how how the existing advertising system works on here but uh

uh if you really want to motivate them you know give them give them commission-based sales and

and you'll you'll watch them be uh chasing after uh customers morning, noon, and night. So

anyway thank you.

I'm out of food and money once again. I think I have five dollars left in my PayPal, but

that's all I have. I've been eating McDonald's mostly. I got one of those vape

juice bottles with the last donation and McDonald's, and that's what I've been eating.

I go to Walmart some, but it seems to throw off whatever mechanism I'm in.

I'm stuck awake all night every night again, and it feels like my nose is clogging and then

declogging over and over again. So I try to shift around to adjust it and put on the Breathe Right

Strip to separate my nostrils, but it just keeps like my nose will clog and then I'll move around

and I'll unclog and then I'll clog. And it'll happen while I'm sleeping and cause me to snore.

So I have to be really careful about how I adjust my nose so that it functions properly.

I don't know what's causing it. I'm doing everything I can to be able to sleep at night,

but having my nose clog and then be completely unreliable for breathing purposes

isn't helping. So that's one of my many issues I'm going through. But like I said, I'm out of

food and money and any donations would be appreciative. I'm very thankful of the donations

I've received up to this point. So anyway, thank you.

So I'm sitting in my hotel room in Uptown Suites in North Austin and my last video did really well,

so I'm pretty happy with that. I probably got $200 in donations and was able to receive my

TikTok paycheck from last month. What happened is I changed my email on my TikTok,

the PayPal email, and it was still set to the old email in the TikTok account. So I had to add the

I had to re-add the old email in my TikTok PayPal and then the money came right through. So anyone

else that has that problem, you just have to add a secondary email and make it your old email

and then the money ships right over. So that was the solution to that. But you know I'm trying to

get through these nights where I can't sleep and I've been I started running these lights

you know 24-7 and I feel bad about it, but it seems to help. You know usually I have the

blinds closed, but I've been running these lights 24-7 to kind of get the spooks out of

out of my head and it seems to help a little. But I think if I throttle it just right,

I can start turning off lights and just get all the night tremors out of my system.

But I'm pretty happy with how TikTok is going. Like I said, I have an Instagram account too,

but it doesn't do quite as well. So if I put more work into it, it might. But TikTok seems to be

where it's what started this whole thing because like I've said before, I was sitting on the side

of the road with a sheet of cardboard in central Florida near in Melbourne, Florida to be specific

on I-95 on the interstate on I-95. And I had a tablet and decided to turn it around on me

and record a video with the camera and then went and uploaded the video to TikTok. And that's what

started this whole thing. So it's going pretty well now. You know, I'm still working at it to

see what I can get out of it. But it's what moved me to Austin and then I started like working at

like a job where I have speeches planned out and then I upload the video and see what comes through.

But I'm going to keep working on the donation system in this thing. Thank you very much once

again for the donations. I've been buying McDonald's and I don't know, I got beer and

one of the Walmart footlong sandwiches.

And so I'm happily eating, which is wonderful because for the past six months

before this, I was living off Top Ramen and mixed vegetables, which wasn't the

the most complete diet. I got everything I could out of it, but it wasn't the most complete diet.

Now switching to McDonald's and big sandwiches and even getting calories out of

beer, I just feel a lot better. So the food I'm getting out of this money is like

if you want to cheer up, you know, if you're trying to find ways to cheer up, the best way to do that

is just strain yourself of everything. And then the smallest things are the most amazing things.

So like if you've been living off Top Ramen for six months, having McDonald's meal is the best

tasting thing ever. And that's what I'm going through now because I've been eating McDonald's

three meals a day. Big breakfast in the morning and then those $5 meal deals

throughout the day. So this is going pretty well. I'm going to keep working on

getting through all this baggage, but I'm still sitting in North Austin at Uptown Sweets and

trying to find the best path to take. Anyway, thank you.

I've spent time all over the place. One of those places is Southern California,

and I always, you know, I'm thinking about bouncing between Southern California,

Central Texas, and Central Florida as my like three spots, and just giving up on everything

else. But anyway, going back to Southern California, because my TikTok page has

gotten a few followers on it, I'm wondering if I can get my foot in the door in Southern

California in the whole Hollywood scene. But the issue is, I don't have any transportation

and housing. I've gotten stranded there before. Now, I have lived in an RV park in Van Nuys,

and I had a Yamaha R1 that I would ride up and down the Holland Highway. So I was looking around

that whole square, and I saw this ranch, Calamigo's Guest Ranch, on another video on here,

and thought, maybe it's a place to work. I have so much ranching experience from

Northern Nevada. We had a cattle ranch, and then Central Nevada, we had another ranch that

didn't have any cows, but had wild horses. And I spent quite a bit of time at both of those,

plus all the time I spent in Alaska just out in the brush. And a lot of the cabins in Alaska

look similar to the cabins at this ranch. So I was thinking I could maybe interview for a job

there and actually be an employed part of society. It seems to be the first opening that's

available, and I would just try to be a dishwasher or something small, and then keep uploading videos

to TikTok and Instagram, and see if I could get a little higher up the totem pole.

Because the problem I'm having with social media, just telling my stories on here, is it's not

paying very much money. Because I got good at uploading videos and telling stories, it might

help get my foot in the door in Hollywood and get into some sort of acting role. I have a big old

story from Las Vegas that I'm not a very good screenwriter, but it would be a good movie.

And I know everyone comes along with some screenplay to present, but it would be an

interesting Hangover-esque movie. So that would be my attempt, is getting that whole 10-year party

I had out there produced into a movie. There's a few others, you know. Alaska, my dad was a

bush pilot in Alaska, so growing up, you know, you could probably get something out of that too.

And I don't know, maybe something in Arizona, although the big Vegas one would be

producible. Because the Hangover made so much money, you know, walking in with a

completely different story about Las Vegas might make a few bucks for everyone involved.

That's what I'm doing right now, just looking for jobs. And the first one that seems to be

available is this Calamigos Guest Ranch, but I don't have a way to go over there. I have no

transportation whatsoever. I would have to physically walk up there and talk to people and

try to get to know everyone to get my foot in the door, to get a basic dishwasher, barbeque,

maintenance job there. So anyway, thank you.

It's going through my dating history in the past.

Why I'm more hesitant when I'm older trying to date.

Part of the problem is I'm not making as much money as I used to.

Or any money for that matter.

So that makes it more difficult.

If a girl shows up willing to pay for anything, pay for everything,

then I date pretty quickly.

But me having to pay is much more difficult these days.

Because before when I was in Vegas I was making $150,000 a year.

So it was really easy to go take girls out on dates.

Whereas now I don't even think I'm making $10,000 a year.

It's probably less than that.

So if any really wealthy women show up and want to pay for everything,

I'd be open to dating.

But short of that, I'm not pursuing it very much.

But going back, I fall into a weird category.

Because I've always been kind of a computer nerd and into technology

and all sorts of science-y stuff.

But I'm also well endowed.

So I think as a legal disclaimer I'm supposed to say that

I don't want to do any damage or surprise anyone or anything.

But being well endowed, that puts me in a different category

like the adult entertainment category instead of the nerd category.

Which I'm always trying to be in the nerd category.

And it makes it more difficult.

Now, I wouldn't trade the thing for a small one.

But it creates this middle ground I'm in

where it works in certain areas but not others like TikTok and Instagram.

There's plenty of attractive people on there.

So I don't have to worry about upsetting anyone being well endowed.

But I can't venture out very far.

I have to stay in that circle or in the adult entertainment circle

or in the strip club circle.

I can't really go to where normal people function.

But I spend all my time learning about technology and new science stuff.

So it does put me in this kind of weird position.

If I devote to one side or the other,

I tried to devote entirely to just being a computer nerd.

And the whole thing fell apart on me.

I ended up getting with a lot of girls while I was there.

And that caused the whole thing to fall apart.

But I was running my own IT business for a good six years

before it all just caved in on me.

Because when one girl finds out I'm well endowed,

then her friend finds out, and then her friend's friend.

And the whole thing cascades on me.

And, you know, I have to back out of the whole thing

because all this drama starts.

And I don't want to risk any injury to myself or others.

And it always seems to upset some boyfriend or ex-boyfriend,

cousin, brother, father, nephew, I don't know.

There's always some guy upset with me getting with a girl

and then getting with her friend inadvertently

just because she, quote-unquote, wanted to try it out.

And that's just the curse of having a big dick.

It goes from one to the next because everyone wants to see it or try it out.

When I tried adult entertainment like 10 years ago,

I could never make a cent at it.

You know, it was just pictures online

and in the generic adult entertainment sites.

And I just couldn't get my foot in the door.

And I'm not gay. I'm completely straight.

So it always seemed like it would go into some gay territory,

which I didn't want.

I don't want to be gay. I'm not gay.

I don't have anything against them.

Be what you are, more power to you and stuff.

But I don't want to do anything with any guys.

So I kept thinking I was going to end up stuck with all of them

if I even tried to pursue it anymore.

So I kind of gave up and went back to trying to be a nerd

and then went bankrupt doing that.

So now I'm open to all options and earning a living.

But being stuck while endowed, you know,

it brings my career options down considerably

because everyone gets worried that I'm going to stretch some girl out

and I can't work at normal employments because coworkers want to see.

And it gets embarrassing quickly.

But I'm going to keep looking for career paths and which way to go.

Anyway, thank you.

I've been operating with very little money for quite some time, and looking at society and how

things operate, the biggest thing I can't understand is how billionaires operate.

I can't even imagine a billion dollars. I think I have $200 right now, maybe $250,

and using that, like a billion dollars, how do you even spend it? It doesn't look like there's

anything you can buy for a billion dollars. Like looking at junk land, let's say you spend

a billion dollars on junk land, well that would be, I don't know, you know, at $600 an acre,

you're at what, 1.5 billion acres? What do you do with 1.5 billion acres? And what does that do

to, you know, like the towns and communities nearby? You know, you can't even buy it because

it's too much. No one can actually purchase that much land, at least to the best of my ability,

you know, best of my understanding. I don't even know what you could possibly do.

If it were up to me, you know, I'd set the cap at like $10 million or something. So the most

you can have is $10 million, and the rest goes to like social welfare and education

and infrastructure and stuff like that. But you know, having a billion dollars,

there's nothing you can really buy. Even like luxury boats and stuff. If you purchase

some of those gigantic luxury yachts that are like $300 million, you still have to have a lot

of people on board the ship, kind of turning it into a cruise ship. You know, you don't even own

it at that point. Despite spending $300 million on it, you have to maintain a crew and staff and

guests. So you're just like working for a cruise ship. You know, you didn't even buy the boat.

It's owned by the crew and guests and everyone involved. So this takes me back to my point of,

you know, what's the point of having the money in the first place? Even the houses,

you know, like some of these mansions, you know, they'll want $50 million for a house.

And it'll be on less than an acre of land. And sure, it's like 8,000 square feet or something,

but less than an acre of land is incredibly small. And so this money system

doesn't really make sense because you can go get a single family home for $80,000

and have a wife and kids in the thing. Whereas this $50 million house,

it's much more difficult to get married and have kids in the overpriced mansion

that's on smaller land. You know, you get more land for $80,000 than you do for $50 million,

at least from what I can tell. And also, you know, there's other factors to consider that

don't take into account, you know, how much something costs monetarily, like how good the

school system is, how well you'll fit in in the community, stuff like that. So this whole system

seems skewed because if I say, all right, a single family, two bed or three bed, two bath home

for $80,000, and then scaling that up to a billion dollar house. So you're going from

an $80,000, $1200 square foot house to a billion dollar house. How big would that billion dollar

house be? It would be multiple skyscrapers or more. You know, you'd have a city at that point,

that is enough money to buy a city, which doesn't even seem to happen. Because if you have a

billion dollars, you can't buy a city with it. So it doesn't really add up correctly that if you

have $5, you know, you buy a McDonald's, Big Mac, if you have and then if you're in the billion

dollar bracket, you spend you know, what $500 and get the same hamburger. So I don't know how the

monetary system works. Some seems way off like there's a missing gap or missing piece in it

because it just doesn't add correctly. And if you're in a high income bracket, you're still

like living the same life as a low income bracket. It's just like your car has stitched leather seats.

Whereas instead the low income bracket, your car has cloth seats. It just it doesn't seem worth

or it doesn't seem to add up to the same amount of money. Or it doesn't seem to add

quite correctly. So this is what I've been thinking about. I also gave it some thought,

you know, being at the bottom of everything. What irritates other people like I don't want

to upset anyone. I'm trying not to make anyone angry. So I do my best to not do that. And the

first thing that would upset everyone is having a bunch of money. You know, then everyone's just

kind of upset with you. So to reduce that, it almost seems like not worth it to have the money

in the first place. Because everyone's mad because you have so much money. So

this is what I'm thinking about today. Anyway, thank you.

Well, my appetite is all over the place. You know, I'll be hungry one minute and then not hungry the

next and then starving and then not hungry again. So, I haven't been keeping much food in my hotel

room apartment. And at like 10 or 11, right when everything closes, I'll get really hungry.

And then, think about it all night, thinking I'm starving and then at 5 or 6 a.m. when the

stores start opening again, then I'm not hungry. You know, I start feeling, I don't want to say

sick to my stomach, but loss of appetite would be the description for it. And I don't know what's

causing it. You know, if it's some like night tremor or whatever. Because I'm having weird

dreams. I got a few hours of sleep last night during the night. And just having weird dreams

and they're keeping me up. And then having my appetite go around all over the place

isn't helping. So, I've been eating mostly McDonald's. It's good and fattening. You know,

great for cheap calories. And I really like the meals. You know, the big breakfast and

burgers are really good there. So, that's where I've been eating. But having my appetite switch

around all over the place is strange. And the only bad habit I have left is vape. You know,

I had two beers last night. And I do have a few beers every couple days.

But it's not, you know, it's not one of these extreme things. And I don't think it's really

even that bad for me. If I started drinking excessively, then it would be. But it's not

that many beers. I'm still vaping a little bit. Although I can just see it cycling out. You know,

I'm just cycling out vape entirely. And I haven't had a cigarette in probably two months.

So, cigarettes are gone. I could not be more relieved about that.

Now, I'm just down to being able to sleep at night, stabilizing, and having my appetite

more predictable. So, I'm working on how to be more predictable

patterns of how I operate in day-to-day life. So, anyway, thank you.

I got OkCupid going again. I had this site when I was in Vegas and it was a big part of my

party there. It was so easy to pick up girls and go to their hotel room or have them show up at

my house or whatever with OkCupid. It made everything easy just to go on a date and have

a party. So I got this thing restarted again to see if there's any money in it. Just for one thing,

telling my story about it because it was the the most successful part of the whole party sleep

around phase while I was in Vegas. It's nice because I can instantly say well endowed,

have no STDs, only light jock itch, stuff like that. So that makes it really easy to

know what someone's age is, what someone's backstory is, and what they have. I always

liked it for that reason. I had more trouble picking up girls at bars because I just couldn't

know enough about them beforehand to make an approach. Whereas if you if you build one of

these online dating profiles, you can know everything about someone

before even making contact with them. So I always thought it was safer for that reason.

TikTok has a little bit of the OkCupid vibe to it but it doesn't allow

for the complete profile of everything your backstory is and everything you're doing.

So the two sites are pretty similar but operate differently. If you put a little more

OkCupid on TikTok, you'd have all these dating parties and stuff like that. But it doesn't

really have a option for the profile system that OkCupid does. I like them both. I like

TikTok and OkCupid but they definitely serve different purposes. So I'm gonna keep browsing

around on here and see if I can find a wealthy woman to just pay for everything and I don't

have to do anything. It hasn't happened yet but maybe I'll pull it off. Anyway, thank you.

Ever since my van got towed while I was in Central Florida, you know, I was walking around

there for like a year, year and a half, and just sleeping in the brush or sleeping wherever.

And I kept hanging out at the Greyhound bus stop because I'd given up on aviation by that

point. The last plane ride I took, I had a F-150, I was in Fairbanks, Alaska, and I went

bankrupt and took a plane down to Los Angeles. And that was the last plane ride I ever got

in. And ever since then, you know, I've been using the bus or my own transportation. So

I got another Ford E350 van, ended up just getting kind of scattered in the thing, driving

around all over the place, went bankrupt with it too. So Ford did not work well for me.

Went bankrupt with it too, and then was stranded in Florida for a year and a half. And then

finally got a bus ticket, a Greyhound bus ticket in Florida, and took the Greyhound

bus from, I think, Melbourne, Florida to Austin, Texas, where I am now. And I've only made

it like two miles from where that Greyhound bus stop is in Austin. So it has very short

legs once you get off the bus. You know, I've been here like two years. And once you get

off the Greyhound bus, you know, you're usually pretty close to where the bus stop is. It's

amazing to think about, you know, what the tracks are of different transportation vehicles.

And you know, like if you have your own car, you can go indefinitely. I don't know what's

going on with the interstate. You know, how many people can drive on the interstate, and

who's allowed to take their personal vehicle on the interstate. It really seems like there's

some kind of bracket kind of holding everyone in the cities, so they can't go on the interstate

just wild. You know, if it were up to me, I would have it so you could just take your

personal car on the interstate wherever you wanted to go. But how it looks, from what

I can see, is it's kind of bracketed where, you know, not everyone's allowed to go on

the interstate. So I don't know what that's about. But, you know, theoretically, with

your own car, you could just drive on the interstate wherever you wanted to be whenever

you wanted. But the Greyhound bus, you know, you can only go to the bus stops with it.

And it takes forever to get anywhere. Sometimes you have extremely long layovers. So that

makes it more difficult. But I like the Greyhound better than the airport system, just because

you seem to hold your ground a lot better when you get to your destination. You can

just sit wherever, and it's just more comfortable. Whereas anything to do with airplanes, you

know, you're not holding ground at all. You're up in the air. Anyway, thank you.

I just walked for maybe two and a half, three miles, and it's hot.

So while walking,

I saw this billboard and that is the most Nevada looking symbol I have ever

seen. I looked up these guys at online a few weeks ago and because I'm from a

rodeo town, which is Winnemucca, you know,

everything revolves around the rodeo there. Having these Austin gamblers,

which is one of the PBR league teams,

really is familiar to Nevada. I mean,

Texas is so much bigger and stronger and, and quote unquote better. You know,

I don't want to piss anyone off in Nevada, but I really like Texas.

They have a much bigger, more professional rodeo team.

I think Reno has a little one or a good size one, but,

but it doesn't have the grandeur of this Austin gamblers.

And, uh, uh, I don't know.

It's been a long time since I went to a rodeo, so I don't,

uh, I don't remember what it's all about,

but, uh, uh, when, uh, like I said, when I was a kid,

um, I grew up on a cattle ranch. So the rodeo was part of my, uh,

kind of existence. And, uh, one time, I think, uh,

a horse ran into the fence and died. And then, um,

we weren't able to go to rodeo again after that.

I don't know what it was all about. This was in Winnemucca. And, uh, I hadn't,

I'd never went to a rodeo after that, other than like barrel racing. You know,

I went barrel racing for a few years. Um, but, uh, uh,

never went to one of the conventional big rodeos ever. So, uh,

it's nice to see it's still going strong. Anyway. Thank you.

Made my way over to the Greyhound bus stop, and here it is. You know, everything looks great.

This Greyhound bus sign should be good to go. I was here two years ago. You know, it was a great

bus stop. You know, vibrant, full of life. Oh no, here we go. So it looks like they closed it down.

So Greyhound is out. I don't know what happened with this thing, but it is down.

They might have moved it. I just came over on foot because I was getting way too pent up in

the apartment, and decided to walk around. But here it is. It was, you know, two years ago.

It wasn't even that long ago. This was a very populated bus stop, and now it appears to be

gone completely. Fenced off, graffitied, and left to ruin. So I don't know. You know, I appear to be

thinking differently than the rest of the country, because I thought, you know, maybe I'm thinking

about global warming too much, or that there's not enough metal in the ground to keep producing so

many cars. But you know, I thought Greyhound was the way to go. You know, it uses the least amount

of gas. It's the cheapest way to get around. And apparently I am not in sync with everyone else

in the country, because everything I have been putting my efforts into keeps doing this.

And so this thing shut down on me. I don't know how well the brand itself is doing.

But the very track I used to get to this spot has closed. So I'm stuck. Anyway, thank you.

I was actually to get a couple hours of sleep last night. I think I woke up at like 6.

I went to sleep at probably 3. So it's still difficult to sleep at night.

I went down to the park. You know, I have like $18 in my bus pass, so I made it down to the park.

It's a nice spot. Austin is really pretty in the nice areas.

Nicer than that abandoned Greyhound bus stop. But the abandoned Greyhound bus stop is

much more wild. So I know I should probably just avoid the whole thing,

but it would be interesting to get footage of that. I used Greyhound, you know, ever since I

was a small child. I always like coveted Greyhound. I thought it was the best thing ever. I wish they

didn't close that bus stop. I don't know why it closed. They may have moved locations on the thing,

but it's a shame. So I'm going to sit out here. There's people fishing,

people walking around. I'll do a few laps around the park and see what to do with the day. But

once I get my sleep cycle working correctly, I'll be a lot more productive. Anyway, thank you.

Still low on money. I think I have $57 in my cash app. I do want to thank everyone for the donations.

I saw one donation requested. I say thank you to the individual donator. I think Caden is how you

pronounce the name. Anyway, thank you Caden. I received your $10 and it is much appreciated.

And thank you to everyone else. Right now, mostly what I'm getting is

Lotrimin antifungal spray and food, McDonald's, and I got a case of beer.

I'm way down on how much vape I'm going through. So, you know, I haven't needed vape in like a month.

But, you know, I could use new clothes. I haven't done laundry in a while.

Maybe a better pair of walking shoes. I have these construction boots that are steel toe

and big and heavy. They're not the best for walking around, but they do the job pretty well.

So that, you know, goodwill for $10 shoes. Just sneakers so I could walk around a little more.

I forgot, when I really start doing this, it requires a lot of walking to get footage that's

actually interesting. So, you know, shoes are incredibly important. Like, shoes are like your

car. So if you have good shoes, you can go a long ways. If you have uncomfortable shoes,

you can't go very far. So I've had these boots for maybe six months, and they've been used

extensively, but they are not the best for walking. They're good for construction, not for

walking. So I've been eyeing sneakers. Anyway, thank you for the donations again. I could, any

little bit helps. I'm sitting at $57. I should get my TikTok money on the 15th, but it's like $100.

$150, I think, so it's not very much. But anyway, thank you again.

I've been working on ways to do fundraisers with this thing, and up to this point, you know,

I've just been sitting out in the places where it's common to hold up cardboard

and politely asking for money on here, which seems to be working.

This page has relied on donations since the start. As I said before, how it began,

as I was sitting on the side of the road with a sheet of cardboard, and I had a tablet,

and I decided to just upload a video from the tablet to see what would happen.

And that was a few years ago now. And I started getting my in that way.

So I'm sticking with that basic principle. The premise for the channel to begin with was

just yelling into the phone whatever I was thinking that second, and uploading,

and just letting it do whatever it's going to do online, which has produced some comedy up to this

point. But I'm going to keep running with that premise to see what I can get through. The

funding, you know, I'm trying to keep this going to the best of my ability. But like anything,

money is required to keep it going. So any donations would be appreciated. Anyway, thank you.

This is something I put a lot of thought into because most of my childhood and 20s were swept

up in aviation. But I've come to the conclusion that just avoiding aircraft entirely is the

best bet. I was in one plane crash, as I've said before, which kind of, you know, I was

done with aviation after that thing. But the problem with airplanes is they seem to rip you

away from whatever social circle you're in and kind of bring you down in society.

So I think without going near one or having anything to do with them in the first place,

you end up much higher and richer in the community because you're kind of always there,

you know, people can rely on you. The second you start getting in airplanes,

you go way too far away. No one knows if you're going to make it back or not.

It seems like kind of a waste. When I went through everything, the best I could come up

with to make progress as like a species is reducing conflicts between people, you know,

just reducing war, reducing fighting, reducing all of that and not being a waste of resources,

meaning, you know, not use up all the metal, gas, I don't know, whatever precious

things are being used that we can't reproduce to create all this stuff,

you know, being really conservative with all of that seemed like the best option.

And because we have these phones and cameras and technology, you can just radio or call

whoever you need to call on the other side of the world if you want,

without having to actually physically go there. And that really helps for

staying with the community that looked after you up to that point, rather than just kind of

deserting everyone with an airplane. I thought about this with my dad because he got swept up in

being a bush pilot. And he was a football player. He was close with his family,

became a pilot, moved to Africa and the Middle East. And then after coming back,

after coming back, ended up moving to Nevada and never spoke to his relatives again. So

becoming completely distant with his family. And that carried over to me because I had no way to

contact him or have anything to do with him. Because they were so detached when I was born.

I think because of aviation in general, you know, if aviation had never gotten in the way in the

first place, they would have stayed close, it would have been a healthy, comfortable family,

instead of everything being thousands of miles apart. And Alaska was a big part of this.

Anything to do with Alaska is so far away, that you end up kind of deserting everyone going up

there, you know, you're just ditching everyone when you go up there. And you know, then they

don't trust you after that. It's difficult to get back in. It's another one of these things,

they don't know if you're gonna make it back or not. So I'm really hesitant about going to Alaska

again. You know, if it was absolutely crucial for me to go up there, I would go up there again.

Otherwise, I'm staying out of it. I like Texas, I like Florida, and I like Southern California.

So I'd want to stick with those three. Plus, it's not ditching everyone. You know,

the biggest problem, this entire, you know, my entire existence is based off of

running off of community support. And anything to do with any long-distance travel hurts that,

you know, and then I don't have, you know, I'm breaking down how much community support I have.

So I'm trying to avoid long-distance travel. I've traveled way too much up to this point,

so I'm just trying to build on what I got. And looking for ways to get back up there,

and looking for a paycheck is the biggest motive right now. But also, you know, it's

starting a future, building a family, all that stuff. And traveling around does not help with

any of that. So that's my two cents on the subject. Anyway, thank you.

Made it back out to the park. It takes like an hour on the bus to get out here.

So it's an ordeal to make it. Now I'm trying to use my time wisely to sit out here as long

as possible because it's an extremely peaceful place. There's a bunch of people out walking

around and dogs and birds and people fishing and all the normal stuff. This has got to be

one of my favorite parks ever. The one in Orlando was pretty good too, but this is either

close second or first place on them. I think I just like Austin more than Orlando, Florida.

The problem with Orlando is it's so far away from where I'm from that there's almost a

language barrier in Florida, whereas in Texas I don't have as much of an issue with it

because going from the west coast to the east coast, you know, it's a whole different kind of

dialogue between people. So Orlando's another really nice city,

but I think Austin's my favorite. So anyway, thank you.

So I've been going through my past and what I've done and everything I've been through.

And speaking of dating, I've probably been on dates, you know, like actual conventional dates

with like 200 girls, got somewhere with 100 of them, and actually slept with them with like 30

of them. I actually slept with about 30 of them. So I think that's where I'm at. I had to stop

entirely because I was going to get in way too much trouble if I kept doing that. So I stopped

for like eight years or seven years just to get everything reset. Plus I was trying to get through

all my parents' crime. So it wasn't helping, you know, me going around dating women everywhere.

So I had to pause the whole thing. But the only STDs I ever really caught,

I think I caught HPV, just the oral cold sores, although I never have symptoms of them.

I think I had might have had one cold sore two years ago, but it would have been, you know,

it could have been a zit too. I can't confirm. So that's really minor. You know, I got jock itch,

which I go on about a lot. And I think I got chlamydia one time. I took the penicillin or

whatever prescription drug for it and it cleared right out. And, you know, I got STD checked

regularly and tested all clean. So clean on STDs. But I think I got HPV along the way,

which isn't the biggest deal in the world, considering, you know, I never have any symptoms

from it. But going back, every different city I was in, you know, I could just go on online dating

and just kind of browse around and get girls numbers and go out on dates. And that's what I

was doing. And it was mostly, I don't know, Vegas, Los Angeles, Boise, Oregon, Alaska, Anchorage,

Alaska. I think those were the main cities I did the online dating game with. And it went okay.

You know, I would usually end up settling on there. The girls weren't the prettiest.

They were very interesting to talk to, like a lot of very educated women, career minded, you know,

making a lot of money doing their jobs, but just not the most attractive. So that's part of the

reason I gave up on the thing. And what made me enthusiastic about TikTok is it's just people on

there are much more attractive. So that's what that's what started my enthusiasm on TikTok.

I don't know, you know, I'm sitting at the park right now. I don't know what path to take. I'm

I'm trying to find the best career path to go on. Because every you know, the second I start one,

I'm stuck on that path for who knows how long. So like bartender path,

hospitality, you know, working for hotels, going back to it, which is what I was doing before.

I'm film, film production and content creation, you know, what I'm doing on here.

And, you know, we were just talking or I was commenting in the comments section

about doing a documentary on on my entire life, which has been a long, potentially interesting one

on that, you know, you could actually use a film studio to produce and that may make some money. So

that's another career path I might look into. So that's what I'm doing right now. I'm trying

to spend as much time at the park as possible. I was sitting in that hotel room way too much.

And there's only so much doom you can play. So I'm sitting at the park instead just to

just to clear out of the hotel room for a while and get some outdoor time because it's so

incredibly nice out here that it's a fun place to be. And it's a fun place to people watch and

try to make connections and, and get my foot in the door and whatever

the next thing I get myself into is going to be. So anyway, thank you.

Made my way back over to the Greyhound bus stop. I slept for like six hours and now I can't get

back to sleep, so I'm back over here still trying to figure out why this thing shut down.

It was, you know, this is the exact bus terminal I used to go from Florida to Austin

and where I am now, and it seems to have closed abruptly, so I don't know what's going on.

It almost instantly closed and then got covered in graffiti. I was thinking more about, you know,

my past and dating and everything I've done and all that stuff, and I've come to the conclusion

now that if it doesn't lead to a marriage with kids, I'm not going for it. You know,

I'm not going for any of this club rat stuff and one-night stands and all that. If it goes

to a marriage with kids, then I'll start entertaining the possibility of dating,

but if it's anything short of that, I'm just not bothering. It's not worth the trouble,

and I would get in more trouble if I tried to continue what I was doing before in Vegas,

so that's really where I'm gearing everything towards. So I'm trying to get my career path and

where I live and everything sorted to that goal, so everything I do has to

have room for a marriage with kids, and that's why I keep getting stuck because I don't know which

career path to go on, you know. Like being a bartender, it's going to be a lot of temptation.

Working for the hotels is also temptation everywhere, so I'm going to keep trying to

find the best way through. Videography works, you know. I can make it through with videography just

because at the end of the day, you're just pointing a camera at yourself and talking,

so it's really easy to stay out of trouble, especially with a camera on you at all times

because it's difficult to commit any crime when everything's being recorded, and everything you

do, you end up saying. Like all I can do is talk now, so I don't have any secrets whatsoever,

and everything I'm thinking just goes straight into the camera.

So, you know, it keeps you really clean from crime and any sort of

secretive behavior, so that's why I like the content creator film production path.

So I'm going to keep working on it and see if I can earn more of a living with this thing,

you know. That's really where I'm getting stuck. If I had more money coming in, it'd be more

encouraging to continue. So anyway, thank you.

After a considerable voyage on city buses, I finally made it to the Greyhound bus stop.

Here it is. It is populated and small, and it's on the other side of the city from the other one.

The other bus, I don't know why they closed down that stop. It was walking distance from

where I'm from. This one is, or where I'm staying, this one is considerably farther.

I had to take two city bus transfers, and then I got off at the wrong spot, so I had to walk

another mile and finally made it to the actual Greyhound bus stop. This is my main form of

transportation. When I need to get around the country, I just use Greyhound. It's cheap and

stays on the ground, which I like. Like I said before, I've been on plane crash,

so I don't want to get in airplanes, like at all. So, I ended up switching everything to Greyhound.

It works well enough. You know, you have all the bus problems with it, but it seems to do its job.

This one, this is a much smaller terminal than the last one was, so I don't know what happened,

or station, or whatever you call them. I don't know what happened to that other one. It's kind

of a shame it closed down. Here's another pan around to this one. I'm trying not to get pictures

of people's faces too much, but that's the bus, the stop, and there's the bus. So, I don't really

have a reason or funding to use it right now, but you know, if I get in contact with the right

people and the right paycheck finds its way to me, you know, I'll hop on this thing

wherever to earn a living. Anyway, thank you.

I've been going through ways to keep this going and try to turn a profit with it.

And one of the issues I'm having is this Motorola stylus camera. You know, it has difficulty

focusing and it's mostly at night. You know, when I take the night videos, I have to manually lock

the focus on it to maintain mostly clear picture. Otherwise, it blurs in and out.

And I've been trying, I tried to return the phone and get another one and I looked online and other

people were having the same issue with the same phone. Now this thing was 80 bucks, so

it's a cheaper phone than some of the others. I know, I can guarantee, you know, Samsung Galaxy,

Google Pixel, iPhone all probably take better video than this one. But it's a shame because,

you know, I bought this thing because I had a 50 megapixel camera and because it doesn't

focus correctly, I have to manually lock the focus every time. So trying to do panarounds,

like I had it focused on my face, but I had to manually lock the focus. So if I try to do a

pan around now, it's all going to be blurry. And that's just, you know, I guess you get what you

pay for and there's no way to fix it. I have tried everything and I have really liked Motorola

for a long time. You know, they have been my favorite cell phone company for a long time.

But the camera on this thing, you know, I have to fight with it constantly.

So I was going to go over, you know, I don't have any money really.

Um, I think I got $120 in last month from TikTok and that just came in, but I'm just kind of using

it to buy food because I just buy food until I run out of money and I ask for money again.

And that's all I'm really doing until a real paycheck comes in. And I'm using this thing to

find the best option to take as far as employment. Um, because, uh, it, it appeared,

it's the direction I'm headed in is just this film production, uh, uh, content creator job.

So that's what I'm doing currently, uh, to, uh, to look for employment. And I've lived in Hollywood

in Los Angeles before, but I was homeless the entire time. Uh, well, one of the times I was

homeless. Another time I lived in a 19 foot travel trailer, uh, in Van Nuys and I lived there,

oh, I don't know, 10 months or something. So I lived in Van Nuys for 10 months and in a travel

trailer and then was homeless for like a year and a half, uh, just all over Los Angeles, uh, uh,

from LAX or, or from Newport all the way up to, uh, oh, I don't know, thousand Oaks.

I might've made it that far. And then all the way over to, uh, Coachella, you know,

I walked all of this during the course of that year and a half, because it was just, uh, I was

so addicted to cigarettes that, uh, I would just have to walk and find cigarettes constantly.

Like I couldn't stop doing that. And, uh, that was a problem all over Florida. And finally,

when I got to Austin, I was still, you know, I was walking around just looking for cigarettes

everywhere cause I didn't have any money. I, uh, I don't know what caused it, how I got so

addicted to cigarettes in the first place. But, uh, uh, when I got to Austin, I was able to switch

it over to vape. And then at first I was just vaping like a hurricane. And, uh, uh, after a

while, you know, now I'm slowing down the vape steadily. So that's, uh, cycling out as well.

And I, you know, I haven't had a cigarette in a few months, but it was the worst. You know,

I think partying in Vegas for so long, uh, you know, I really got addicted to cigarettes while

I was in Vegas and it had just become this like constant thing and, uh, uh, where I was just used

to going out and having a cigarette. And I didn't know it got so piled on and so bad until I left

Las Vegas and tried to quit smoking and just wasn't able to, and tried and tried and tried

and wasn't able to, and then went completely bankrupt and then had to go around everywhere

chasing after cigarettes. So, uh, I've gotten the thing pretty well quelled now where it's

just down to vape and it's vape once in a while. And now I got the vape cycling to chewing gum

and I'm chewing gum. Like right now I have vape and I didn't bring gum. I wish I had gum instead.

So I, I've just about got the, whatever twitchy oral addiction I have, uh, I don't know if it's

an appetite jam or what, but whatever a twitchy appetite jam I have, I've got it just about

cycled to regular chewing gum. And, uh, that should, uh, just about, you know,

be the last of my bad habits. Other than, you know, I'm keeping beer in the fridge and like

last night I couldn't sleep, so I had two beers. Um, and, uh, so the beer might linger for a while

now. I'm kind of, you know, I kind of transferred it over to the best of my ability to just beer,

and then I'll drink beer for a while and I can like transfer it back to vape, you know, whatever

that little thing that motivates you. Uh, I'm just cycling it back, back and forth between vape and

beer. Um, so it's, it's carried me this far. Uh, I'll probably be able to cycle, cycle it out

entirely and then just have no bad habits whatsoever. But, uh, it hasn't happened yet.

And I kind of use it, you know, you, you can have stuff that you, you want and, uh, then you,

you spend all day thinking about that thing you want and then you go get it and then you're happy.

So you can, you can make it hobbies. You can, any little, like I, I was just doing the bus nerd video,

um, you know, just learning about buses. I could almost cycle out my entire addictive

twitchy personality to, uh, learning about buses. Um, you know, I just focus on that for long enough

and then that's, that's what I, what motivates me to, to, uh, wake up in the morning and,

and, uh, be productive. So, uh, that's what I'm working toward. Um, I, uh, I have had a lot of,

uh, speaking of buses and why that's starting now, I have, I have always liked buses since,

I don't know. Um, once I got completely out of aviation, uh, in Vegas, I was thinking about,

uh, buying a party bus because they had a bunch of those for sale on Craigslist for dirt cheap,

like $6,000, you know, incredibly cheap vehicles. And, uh, uh, you know, you could, you could drive

them up and down the strip and pick up fares and, and just have a ball with one of them.

I never actually got around to doing it. And then when I got older, I bought an E350 van I ended up

living in. Um, so it never got to do the full party bus treatment, but it was a continuation

of the same thing. So I have always, uh, kind of liked buses. I don't know, maybe it's their

efficiency. You know, I'm so drawn to efficiency after being so poor for so long that, uh, uh,

I looked up the Greyhound buses miles per gallon per passenger, and it's 208 miles the gallon,

which makes it the most efficient form of transportation that's, they use as internal

combustion. There is, you know, there's nothing more efficient than, than the Greyhound bus.

So I thought that was pretty interesting. Anyway, thank you.

Down to 21, 23 on funding.

And I've just been eating McDonald's mostly. I'm getting my, you know,

my sleep cycle is better now.

I was able to sleep last night and I woke up,

I think at five, maybe 5.30.

So everything's getting set correctly on my sleep cycle.

I think I had two or three beers yesterday. It wasn't much.

And I'm still vaping a little bit, but it's not extreme.

So everything's improving nicely.

I'm looking for where the best paycheck is.

I was going through because this TikTok channel was so successful.

I'm going through what the, what the best paths to take.

And I, like I said before, I was in music for a while.

Um, when I was a kid and then, you know,

I went to a bunch of rock concerts as an adult and,

and worked, uh, event staff for, for concerts for awhile.

And, uh, uh, now I'm looking at the, uh,

the fashion industry because it's just so interesting. You know,

when I was in Vegas, uh, I would go to, uh,

costume parties and, and Halloween parties,

and they would have all sorts of different Halloween outfits that they put

way too much time into. Um,

and they were all crude and kind of Mad Max-y. But, uh,

looking at, I watched maybe half an hour of that Met Gala from a few months ago.

And the, um, the, the outfits people were wearing,

um, were almost reminiscent of those Halloween parties,

although a million times better at it. You know, I'm not,

I'm not saying those Halloween parties were anywhere near the quality of the

Met Gala, but, uh, it, it was interesting to see people,

you know, expressing themselves with, with different designs and outfits. So,

um, because this TikTok channel is doing so well,

and there's so much fashion going on on the thing.

Now I'm eyeing that path on, on what I could do for them,

because what started this whole thing is I was working as an

IT contractor,

just doing a network repair and basic computer repair.

And as computers got more reliable, um,

it became more difficult to find work just because, you know, they're,

they're getting so reliable. You don't need to call a repairman.

So I started looking for, um,

different ways to earn a living still using computers and cell phones and

electronics and, uh, content creation was the only option. So, uh,

I started just uploading videos on here. Um, and that's what caused me, uh,

to climb back out of, uh, the pit I was in, um,

in Florida was just uploading videos on here. And now continuing,

if I continue on the same path, um,

I seem to get wedged into kind of like, uh,

fashion shows and, and some music, but, uh,

bringing me back to my point, um,

because computers and electronics are so reliable now,

all we need to do is find content to put on them. You know, what,

what do you view on the screen? That's interesting.

So I'm trying to find content to put on here. And, uh,

and that seems to pay my way in the whole, uh,

social media community. Anyway, thank you.

So I'm out of money once again. I think I spent my last $20 at H-E-B getting Mountain Dew and

sandwiches. So that was the last food I had. I guess I won't be getting a big breakfast this

morning. I'm standing out under the overpass at the Common Cardboard Spot. What I went through

yesterday is I was going to that park, Mueller Lake Park, and it was based on an old airport.

And they closed down the airport and turned it into a park. But it seemed to be conflicting

with the Bible, even now, even after getting converted to a park. So I'm probably not going

to go back there anymore. I'll just avoid it. I'm trying to avoid all aviation. And I thought,

you know, that park, because it was converted to a park, it should be okay. But no, it still

kind of has that airplane thing in it. So I'm kind of blaming it for going bankrupt this time.

But I go bankrupt all the time. So, you know, maybe I'm partially responsible for it.

I'm going to stand out here and see what comes in. It's still early. So I just woke up at like

5.30, maybe 6. So it's bright and early. And I'll stand around out here and see what comes in.

Anyway, thank you.

Shortly after running out of money, I ran out of food, so all I had left was a bag of

bugles and some muscle milk. And I think I still have a few more scoops of that muscle

milk. It really does a great job. You know, it's those protein shakes. You'll see body

builders having them. And they're like a meal in a glass. So I really like muscle milk.

It has all the nutrients and vitamins and all that stuff in it, and it has a lot of

calories and protein in it, so I just feel better after having muscle milk. But it hasn't

really gotten me anywhere because I'm still stuck on the side of the road in a cardboard

spot. It's just instead of using a sheet of cardboard, I'm using a cell phone. And doing

the same routine, though, just walking back and forth and telling my story and seeing

what comes through. I don't know. You know, I've been trying to get this digital version

of cardboard to work, and I don't know which is better. Because, you know, with a sheet

of cardboard, you stand out here, you get money sooner with a sheet of cardboard than

you do with a cell phone. Because you're standing out and people see you all the time. The only

benefit to the cell phone is, you know, you can upload the video and then just sit there

and wait for something to come in. So, I don't know. I'm not seeing that much out of this thing.

I keep trying to make it work. You know, I don't know how to start a charity correctly.

I think you need more involved for an actual charity. And then I would turn this page into

a charitable donation page or channel and get more donations that way. But my simple

little cardboard one has held up to this point. I don't know what the next step is. You know,

I keep running out of money, so I can't really do anything. It's like I was receiving job

offers on here, but I need transportation. And transportation to where the job is located

and housing at the site or housing near the site. Because, you know, I have 63 cents on

my Cash App and zero dollars on my PayPal. So, I can't go anywhere to accept the job.

So, that's what I'm going through. It just puts me back stuck on the side of the road

asking for money because I'm out of food. Anyway, thank you.

I just wanted to thank everyone for their donations. I'm back out at this spot and

it seems to work pretty well. I think I got like $240 maybe $250 in, so in a 24-hour period.

The only way it seems to get the thing to click over though is I have to completely run out of

money and food and then I can legitimately ask for donations. If I don't completely run out of

money and food then it doesn't work. You know the whole thing just doesn't work. So I don't

particularly like running out of money and food. You know this isn't a situation I'm trying to

create. I'm going through and following every possible path on job opportunities that should

become available or are available and running them until exhaustion to try to earn a paycheck.

But it just hasn't come through. You know it's not panning out to anything. So I'm stuck in this

position until an actual job opportunity comes through. So once again thank you very much for

the donations and I'm going to keep telling my story on here and see what happens.

I'm in Austin. I like Austin. But you know wherever a paycheck is that's where I'll be.

So I hope something comes through you know relatively soon. I should be fully work

ready. I have been the entire time to be honest short of acting on my face. You know

I was working 80-hour work weeks in Nevada and all over the country. I was flying around

all over the country repairing pharmaceutical robot machines and got laid off from that job

but never like stopped working. Then I started selling all my houses donating all my belongings

to charity and trying to get you know clear of my parents crime because what got in the way

in the first place was all the crimes my parents had committed were coming up on the radar and I

couldn't do anything about it. So I had to manually go back through everything they ever did

and explain it all and clear any foreign bank accounts and unpaid taxes which I did do

but it took so long it drove me bankrupt doing it and now I finally gotten clear of everything

and I'm just work ready. So you know there's no money you know everyone seems to have

conveniently walked away with all the money but you know I am still work able so I can

just go work a job somewhere and should have a completely clear name of any criminal wrongdoing.

Thank you.

So the two issues that remain are random yelling, which isn't very often. You know,

like right now I don't think I could yell if I wanted to. I have to get like really upset. Like

one little problem has to grow and grow and grow and I start yelling. And the other issue is the

well-endowed thing. The well-endowed thing, I think I'm too big for the general population

and too small for like adult entertainment. So I'm too short for adult entertainment and too

big for the general population. So that puts me in like this no man's land category. So that's,

I think that's part of the reason why I'm stuck out here. And as far as the yelling, you know,

like I was saying, it's like random. You know, I can't predict when I'm going to get upset or when

I'm going to start yelling. And so I'm still trying to work through how to predict that.

I, like I said before, you know, I'm looking for any career path possible. And right now,

you know, I'm thinking any place I take the bus is like bad. Like it's, it's like making it take

longer to get to a law-abiding career path. And being buried under my parents' crime,

you know, it's been sitting dormant unexplained for 50 years. So they went and hid out in Nevada

together and did who knows what and then had me. So, and I'm 42. So this was all before I was born.

And nothing got reported to the police. So there's no way to explain what happened.

And that's what's blocking me from like conventional social welfare and the conventional

system is having all this crime sit unexplained for 50 years. And then asking someone who didn't

have anything to do with it, what happened? You know, it's really difficult to explain

and unpack it all and gear out of the thing. So I'm doing my best. You know,

all I can really do is stand on the side of the road and explain my side of the story.

But my side of the story is extremely incomplete. Because I don't have, you know, I don't have

any details on anything. So she's still squatting out there. My mom is still squatting out there.

The house she's living in now, the neighbors, I was working for Circuit City doing IT,

and I installed their wireless network. And years later, she said she wanted a house.

And I remembered those neighbors and they greased the wheels to buy the house. So the neighbors

wanted me to move into that house. And she ended up wedging herself in there and running me off.

So the neighbors are still on my side regarding that house. I don't know how she creates

situations like this. But it's, you know, trying to explain it all. It's a total pain.

And so I don't know, I'm probably better off not being in Las Vegas anyway. That house is in Las

Vegas. But it's still another one of these things, you know, the neighbors wanted me to have the

house. And she lives there. So she lives in the house the community wanted me to have. I don't

know how to remedy that whole situation. You know, I want to just work somewhere and not look at any

of it again. But that seems to be impossible. I have to go back through every little thing she did

and explain it all and clear any taxes, crime, any sort of association to continue. So that's

one of the things that can get me yelling. If I think about it too much, I'll just start yelling

again, just because it's so incredibly frustrating. So anyway, thank you.

Part of being stuck without transportation is I've had to walk everywhere and it's too dangerous

to walk across the road to get food. So like now, you know, I'll have a car as it comes through,

they just sit in the middle of the crosswalk or some just plow right through. So, you know,

they don't even know if I'm here or not or what I'm doing. And then the other side of the road,

some cars have their turn signals on like that Nissan and turn and others don't have their turn

signal on and turn. So that makes it close to impossible. And they're all going 60 miles an hour.

So it's really difficult to get food as a pedestrian. And I have been trying to work

through this. This is the easy intersection. I already have a string of cars just plowing

right through. And this is the easy intersection. The difficult one is the one over by Walmart,

where there's no crosswalk or anything, you know, you just have to kind of go across.

And there's always, you know, the second you step into the road, there's always some car that comes

whooshing along at 60 miles an hour right as you're halfway across the road. So technically,

I looked on Google Maps and technically it is a crosswalk and everyone crosses there,

but there's no indications, there's no stop signs, there's nothing to show it being a crosswalk.

And it hurts Walmart's business because they want as much traffic in the store as possible. So they

want pedestrian traffic as well as car traffic, meaning they want people to be able to cross the

road to get to the store. And having it all jammed up the way it is to where it's impossible

to be a pedestrian and actually get anywhere safely. You know, one time, I don't know, maybe

a week ago, I had a truck flash its headlights at me like it was stopping. And I kept walking across

the crosswalk right here. And that truck came into me at like an incredible amount of speed.

You know, I had to keep my eyes on him the whole way and kind of almost jog across the road to have

his way. And that was after he flashed his headlights at me, which made me think he was

going to stop. So it's incredibly difficult to be a pedestrian safely. This is in Austin, Texas.

I don't know if this applies universally. But this spot is the worst to try to get food. You know,

I'm getting donations off of here. And then I just go to McDonald's or Walmart and buy food with it.

But getting across these roads is the most dangerous part of the whole thing.

And from what I can tell, everyone is in a car. You know, everyone is driving around somewhere.

And I'm like the only pedestrian. There's one more pedestrian down there, but I'm like

the only pedestrian most of the time. So it is completely a car dominated system. And

this hurts career. You know, I can't get a job. I can't do anything until I can safely walk across

the road. So this is the next obstacle that's in the way that I have to find a way around

that there's no actual opening. You know, that's why I'm just yelling at the cell phone over and

again, because there's no way to tell which way to fix this. I just have to explain myself and

try to unravel what my parents created safely, which has proven to be more difficult than I

would have thought. Anyway, thank you.

So I went up and asked if I could film a clip for TikTok and Goodwill, and they said fine.

Or they said they don't care. So here I am. This is my first in-store clip.

And I'm browsing around at all the random stuff that's here.

There's a little keyboard. It still works. I don't know how much they want for it, but 10 bucks.

But, you know, thinking of music and the site, what to do to earn a living, that would be part of it.

The other thing I was looking at was all the way over here.

I'm trying not to film everyone in the store while I do this, but someone's already on it.

They have a skateboard over here for $10.

And as I was talking about trying to cross the road and it being dangerous, you know, being on foot, needing transportation,

the next logical thing would be a skateboard.

And thinking about how much danger I'd be adding to walking, having a skateboard trying to cross the road,

rather than just doing it on foot, it makes it considerably more difficult.

You know, I've ridden bicycles quite a bit, but skateboards not as experienced.

What started this is I was eyeing electric skateboards as a way to get around.

And even then, you know, trying to dodge all the traffic is the really dangerous part.

So I think I'm stuck on foot for the time being.

I don't know, you know, this pedestrian-car interaction is the most difficult part of trying to get anywhere.

And it doesn't matter if you're pedestrian, if you're on a skateboard, if you're on a bicycle, scooter, even motorcycle.

You know, having to deal with cars is all the danger.

So I'm trying to find the best path to take, like always.

Anyway, thank you.

So I'm back down in the spot. It's near a pond. I shouldn't pan around because there's someone

living over on the across the pond and I, you know, I've been in that situation before and

I don't want to, you know, I wouldn't want someone filming me randomly. So I decided,

you know, I won't pan around this time. But anyway, the reason I'm standing in the spot

is it always seems to remind me of Native Americans and tribes and all the interactions

I've had with them. In Arizona, Alaska, Montana, I, you know, I interacted with the Native Americans,

some. Not quite as, not as much as I would have thought. Oh, and Lake Powell, Arizona.

Um, not as much as, you know, I, I would have enjoyed interacting with them more.

I had some good situations, some bad situations and all points in between,

but generally it was pretty positive. Um, just because the only reason there were bad situations

is we would end up going out drinking and then that would turn into yelling and fighting and

arguing. So, uh, uh, you know, as long as we weren't drinking, that was okay. But,

but once the alcohol got in there, then it got more difficult. Um, but, uh, you know, I,

I had a 19 foot travel trailer, uh, as I've said before, and when I went up to Alaska to live in

Wasilla, I ended up selling that trailer to, uh, the Inuit Native Americans up there. And,

uh, I was going through their whole past. Um, the mountain, uh, Denali, uh, which used to be

called Mount McKinley in Alaska, it's the tallest peak in North America. Well, the Denali name is

from an old, uh, I think it was a tribe, a Native American tribe, but I don't know for sure. It was

one of their words. Um, and there's a whole, uh, it, it was pronounced differently, you know,

they changed it around. The name Denali now sounds, uh, uh, kind of Italian, whereas, uh,

it's actually about a, you know, it's an old Native word that may or may not be based on a

tribe. But, uh, uh, because my dad was a bush pilot, um, I still get into Tolkeetna, Alaska,

which is where they fly the, uh, the mountain climbers to Denali, and they'll, they'll, uh,

park at base camp and, uh, hike up the mountain. And base camp, you know, this is one of those

things, you know, they say, well, I hiked up Denali, but they're landing a plane at like

10,000 feet or something and then hiking the rest of the way. So they're hiking half of Denali.

Um, I'm probably not, uh, I'm probably going to get chewed out for this, you know,

telling mountain climbers they're not actually climbing the mountain, but it would be nice to

have a position from the bottom of the mountain, um, and then climb up the whole thing rather than

flying up to half of it and then climbing half of it. Uh, I don't think there's a road out to

Mount McKinley, Denali. Um, so, uh, you have to fly to it. I've driven, uh, on whatever highway

is nearby and you can see it from the highway, but it's still like 50, 60, 100 miles away.

So you can just barely see the, the top of the mountain. Um, but, uh, uh, like I said,

I ended up selling that travel trailer up in Alaska and, uh, uh, came back down. So

lucky now, you know, kind of wish I had that trailer. It was a great place to stay.

Um, it was only 19 foot. I bought it in Spokane, Washington, and, um, uh, it was a great little

comfortable house. So, uh, that was one of my interactions. It was positive with Native Americans.

You know, I had a few girlfriends that were Native and, uh, uh, it went okay. You know,

once again, it fell back to that drinking thing. You know, as long as we were sober, it's okay.

Once you start drinking, then the fighting starts. So, um, I ended up breaking up with all of them,

but, uh, uh, I, uh, I like interacting with different types of people. You know,

it's just more fun for me. If everyone was the same type of person, you know, if it was

just one type of people everywhere, it's not very interesting. You know, I like diverse,

uh, communities with all sorts of different, uh, cultures and, and, uh, people interacting

with each other. So, uh, that's what brought me to this, this Native American story and,

and why this spot always reminds me of them. So anyway, thank you.

Someone on here asked me what I would do if I had a bunch of money right now.

And you know that's always such a fun question to ask because you know your

mind goes all over the place. At one point you know it's like a mansion with a bunch of strippers

and having huge house parties and stuff like that. And then I was thinking about doing a skit

where just someone picks me up and it shows that I've made so much money doing donations

from donations that I bought a mansion and hired a bunch of girls to come over and

was having huge house parties with the donations. Obviously that is not true.

You know I think I got like 240 bucks in a week ago or whenever that was.

And I'm still going through that. I think there's $100, $110 left of it.

So I've just been eating McDonald's, had a few beers. I don't even know. I might have bought

vape. I'm going through such little vape it's costing like $20 a month. But anyway going back

to what I would do if I had a bunch of money. I would just pay the cops with it. You know just

flat out pay the whatever police department a huge donation to just fix all of this.

I don't know how to fix it. You know it's crime that's been buried for 50 years.

My parents did it. I don't know who they got involved with. I got jammed in the thing being

I was born in Nevada and I got jammed in the thing. So you know when I turned 30 I started

trying to clear it all and it's been a long ordeal. So you know if I had a bunch of money

it would go to whatever local police department you know whatever donation system they have.

I would just donate it all to the police and that would probably improve. You know I would get a

more improved lifestyle I think from just donating to the police than trying to you know

do some elaborate things with it. You know like buying sports cars and big houses and stuff like

that. I've always liked the police. I've always been a big supporter of the police department

and everything the cops do. You know my entire backstory is revolved around parties and

clubs and concerts and the police have always been the backbone of the entire thing.

You know for concert security to even in the casinos when I worked for the casinos the

police were the backbone there. You know we would have to call the police all the time to

have people arrested or trespassed and then arrested. So the nightclubs even my house parties

you know I had house parties in in Vegas and I would always try to stay on good terms with

the police. I don't know if I ever actually had I might have had active duty police officers

at the house party. I can't remember there was one guy I was friends with who was a detective

and then some of his friends would would come to my house parties. So it wasn't very far off

you know it's pretty close to the police in those days too. So I've always been a big supporter of

them. I hope this that I can I can get on the right course to pull out of this thing.

But that's where a large sum of money would go if I got any. Anyway thank you.

As far as earning a living, I've worked a lot of jobs, like I said before. I mean, I can

go through them in chronological order. When I was like 15 or 16, I started an online website

called Online Games and just linked a bunch of Flash and Java games to one website. It

didn't make very much money. It made me like $50 a month, but it was getting a lot of views.

This was in 1999-2000, and it would get a lot of views, like, oh, I don't know, $10,000

a day. I was getting like a million a month. So that was a lot for 1999-2000. And then

after that, I think I worked for Fry's Electronics, which was an old electronics retail store.

And then I worked for the Arizona Biltmore just as a busser, runner for a restaurant,

which was a really nice restaurant. Worked there for a while, and then moved to Las Vegas.

Assisted my mom in buying a ranch, which is part of the pile of crime I'm trying to get

through. But assisted my mom in buying a ranch, and then got a job at Circuit City. Did a

lot of computer repairs and home installations and all sorts of computer networking. I was

a field repair tech, so I was kind of like the Geek Squad guys, only drive around and

just install computers and repair existing ones and stuff like that. So I did that for

a few years, and then ended up working for the Department of Health and Human Services,

doing Cisco networks and routers and switches, setting them up for Indian hospitals. And

did that for about a year, and then started doing network administration, small and medium

sized business network service, so any sort of repairs they need. And I started my own

business with that one, and that lasted about six years. I was making pretty good money

with it, probably close to $100,000 a year. And then after that I worked for the Department

of Defense for more hospitals, for the VA hospitals. They had these pharmaceutical vending

machines, so you put them in pharmacies and they automatically dispense, fill and dispense

prescription bottles. And so I was setting those things up and repairing them at military

bases all over the country. And that lasted about six months. And then, I don't know,

I think I worked for Lowe's in Alaska for like ten months, and then I started doing

a little bit of painting, and just was in the paint department, and it was nothing that

spectacular. And worked for Lowe's in Las Vegas, worked for Office Depot in Las Vegas,

worked for Target in Las Vegas, then worked for Boise State University in Idaho. And then

I was selling houses, I was fixing up and selling houses during all of this. So I had

two houses in Las Vegas that I sold, and then my dad, when my dad passed away, and I inherited

a house in Winnemucca, and I sold that. And then I lived off that money from those houses

for quite a while. So after I left Boise, I was just living off the money off those

houses. And kind of going around everywhere, you know, I was trying to get close to where

my cousins were in Iowa, and then I was like, well, I want to go live on the beach. So I

went and moved to Astoria, Oregon, and lived in Astoria for ten months. And then went bankrupt.

And just, that's when I became homeless the first time. So, and then was homeless in Los

Angeles for like a year and a half. And the first money I got in was my dad's foreign

bank account that had been sitting overseas for fifty years. And I had to pull it over

and pay taxes on it. I got the money out of that and bought a Fat Moto, a little motorized

bicycle, and rode it all the way from Beverly Hills, California to Lake Havasu City, Arizona.

And then bought a van and drove the van around everywhere. And then the van got towed and

I got stranded in Florida and went through the same thing. So, then I started uploading

videos on here, and my mom offered to pay for a hotel room. She is still buried in crime.

You know, she will claim that she's completely innocent, but she is absolutely buried in

crime. So, any association I have with her makes me an accessory. So, I can't have anything

to do with her. I've never been arrested. I'm not on anything. And I'm trying to keep

it that way. So, I can't have anything to do with her because I've become an accessory

to her. Which has compounded upon itself. But she can remotely pay in for a hotel room.

And I can try to just keep telling my story to see if any of this clears. All her crime

is very similar to what my dad's was. He made a bunch of money and then parked it overseas

in a British bank account. Well, it wasn't much money. It was $50,000. But parked it

overseas in a bank account. And that flagged every IRS alarm. And no one ever explained

it. And then I'm supposed to explain it somehow. So, I was able to get the foreign bank account

from overseas to the United States and pay taxes. But all my mom's buried money that

I think all of my paychecks are in there too. It just kind of piled in all at once and I

had to run for it. That's all still jammed up worse than anything. So, that's the big

one. Anyway, thank you.

Once again slept for three or four hours and can't get back to sleep.

And I have like these Mountain Dew cravings in the middle of the night so

now I'm drinking a Mountain Dew. So I've just given up on sleep entirely.

But I was sitting on the computer playing Doom and then I went through

YouTube and went through like the old computers I had and

old devices. Like for instance I had a I think Phillips Velo. It was a little

palm top. So it was a it was about the size of a cell phone but it had a full

keyboard and a stylus. And you know with the

keyboard you could you could type emails and

it would only connect via the telephone line. So you'd have to use

dial-up to connect. But I don't know what happened to that

design. Why don't cell phones have little

keyboards like that thing did in 1998 or whenever it was.

So that and also having a real keyboard you know you can play

like actual video games on it. Like I tried to play Doom on this cell phone

and it was terrible. The touchscreen controls were just not

up for it. So on the laptop you know Doom plays great but on the cell phone

it plays terrible just because the touchscreen controls.

Whereas if if you had a little keyboard attached to the cell phone

then Doom would play you know you could play Doom just keyboard

only. I wish they would bring those keyboards back.

I kind of blame Steve Jobs for this. Like in

their cell phones had keyboards in 2007-2008. I had a Motorola Droid

which had a fold-out keyboard on it. It wasn't

the best keyboard but it was a keyboard. And then Steve Jobs released the iPhone

and it was touchscreen only and everyone got on that bandwagon.

And then everything was touchscreen only. And

I still haven't gotten used to touchscreen only.

I would send out emails, rattle out emails with a physical keyboard

phone all the time and I really preferred that

physical keyboard. Both on the Blackberry and the

Motorola Droid. And so when they got rid of them you know

I never relearned how to use a touchscreen faster than a real

keyboard. See I'm still like I could I could rattle off

text on a Blackberry faster than any touchscreen.

Even today and I haven't used a Blackberry in 10 years.

So I wish they would bring keyboards back.

I'm stuck out here. You can see I'm out in the middle of the

middle of this little meadow where the

where there's no one at and just cooling off.

I can only sit in that hotel room for so long

without just like having to go outside and having to go do something.

So everything you know I'm completely motivated now

by just whatever pays you know whatever puts cash in my hand is where I want to

be. The problem with it is you know like I

was saying before I'm really down on which industries I

can get into. And so I was looking at

like I was saying the acting industry the film industry

which I might be able to get my foot in the door in. I've never

acted in anything. The majority all my experience with any sort of

of film production is just this TikTok channel.

And all I've done with this thing is just whatever I'm thinking I just tell

into the camera and upload it. That's the premise for this whole

channel. So getting into the film industry I don't have any experience

whatsoever doing any kind of acting or

complex film production. But I was looking at Austin

you know they do have a

film studios here and they do produce major motion pictures

in Austin. So I'm gonna start browsing around online and see

see if I can weasel my foot in the door in one of those and just be a stage

hand or lighting guy or or sound or whatever. Just what a

janitor you know the most basic little job in there just to get my foot in the

door and see if I can get anywhere with it.

So anyway thank you.

So I went over to the camera store and because I can't get this thing to focus,

you know, I decided to come over here and see what real cameras look like.

They're filming some kind of a production behind me and my simple little TikTok page,

you know, it's no match for an entire crew of people.

But I went through the waiver at the door and I've been recorded before.

I don't know, I think I was on American Idol and just in the background and I don't know,

a few news channels, Alaska Off-Road Warriors, they were filming a show in Alaska and I drove by

and while I was sitting at the RV park and they, the whole cast and crew showed up with

off-road vehicles and I had to sign a waiver and then was, I think the only thing that made it on

the show was my arm holding like a wrench while they were fixing a jeep. So that's the extent of

my filmography. But I keep coming back to the store. I don't have any money so I can't buy

anything but I like browsing around seeing all the cameras and stuff. I wish I could get more

out of this Motorola. It keeps, you know, it'll work for a while and then just fail miserably

sometimes. Like the last video was, it just blurred for absolutely no reason. I had the focus locked

and I guess when I focus locked it, it was blocked on some other thing than my face and

blurred completely. It has more trouble with night footage than day. Like now I don't have the

focus locked so it works better in daylight. But I'm always kind of browsing around. I've had a lot,

you know, I have a long history in cameras. I think I did black and white photography as a kid

and then went through the whole webcam phase and then SLRs and digital cameras, digital camcorders,

you know, like in 2004 I had a digital camcorder. The first hard drive camcorder is available. It

was all the cheap consumer stuff. I never had anything professional but did, you know, have

extensive camera history before starting this TikTok page. So that's probably what's

helping this thing succeed. I'm gonna browse around here. I don't know what the

rule is about like if someone walks by in the background, you know, showing their face on here,

will that get me in trouble? I still need to learn the answer to that question. They had a sign on

the door as I walked in that was a legal disclaimer that, you know, you may get filmed in a major

motion picture or TV show when you walk in the store. So I can kind of like piggyback off that

for this little channel and skirt around it while I figure out exactly what the rule is

because I still don't know the rules on this thing. So anyway, thank you.

Because it took so much work to get down here, I had to ride the bus and it took, it takes a while

to get anywhere on the city bus, which always makes me think, you know, man I could use a bicycle.

And there's a bicycle store right next door to Precision Camera, so I decided to walk in here

just to see all the bikes. I don't see any e-bikes. They've got to be here. I've had a lot of bicycles

in my history. Bicycles, motorcycles, anything with two wheels. I was eyeing those e-bikes,

you know, as something, you know, it's like my bait to motivate myself. An e-bike would, just

seems like it would be a lot of fun. I've had, I don't know, the bike, there's a few e-bikes.

The bicycle I rode the most was a Specialized Hard Rock, and I saw Specialized had a

Levo or something, I can't remember the name of it, but they had an e-bike that was

excessively expensive but looks like a lot of fun. The issue I'm having is

dealing with cars, with anything. You know, I was looking at skateboards before, now these are

bicycles. Still, it goes back to dealing with cars, you know, in a traffic situation. You put

yourself in so much more danger being on anything on wheels. I mean, walking with my shoes is so much

safer than being on a bike, being on a skateboard, being on a scooter. So I wish there were more

dedicated bike paths and easier ways for pedestrians to get around. Pedestrians, bicycles, scooters.

E-scooters, e-skateboards, e-roller skates, you know, all that stuff. I wish there was a better

way for people to get around, but with these cars, you know, it puts you in so much danger just being

on one because you're going so much faster and, you know, you have to balance yourself the entire

time. So it's a lot more to think about rather than just walking where you can stop when you

need to. And you're going a lot slower, so it's a lot simpler. Bikes are still a big temptation,

but I'd have to get around that danger somehow. Like, being in a place where bicycles are very

common to be able to use one. Anyway, thank you.

Made my way to yet another store. These three are all adjacent to each other, but this is a board

game, comic book, graphic novel store, and they have a bunch of posters in the back. So I've been

walking through seeing all the movie posters, and the one that stood out was Beetlejuice one.

I saw Beetlejuice as a kid and it was always very memorable for me. I'm glad they made a

sequel to it. I know it took forever, but I'm glad they make a sequel. It was one of the first

movies I saw as a kid that I really remember. I mean, I guess Tremors. Stay tuned. Because I'm

from Nevada, Tremors like took over everything because the marketing department of Tremors was

too big for for Winnemucca where I was, and it just kind of took over because the movie was

based in a fictional town called Perfection, Nevada. You know, every little town in Nevada

was suddenly dominated by the movie Tremors, so that was pretty interesting. Beetlejuice was

also very memorable. I haven't seen it in a long time, but I did like it as a kid.

So I'm glad they made a sequel. Some of these are autographed like that X-Men,

and they have quite a few posters in here. I've had the TV off for a few months now

just because I'm doing this TikTok page. It seems to conflict with whatever movie I'm watching

or whatever TV show I'm watching, so I just turn the whole thing off, and I'm trying not to rip

anyone off. So anything I watch, you know, this thing is completely unfiltered. So anything I

watch is then in my head, and then whatever's in my head I just tell into this camera, and that

turns into, you know, potentially ripping people off. So I'm trying not to, and that's why my TV's

been off. You know, I'll play like three or four songs in the morning, just listen to a few songs

in the morning, and that's all that's there. The rest is just me trying to find the best path to

take. And where a paycheck may come in from, because this TikTok page is doing well, you know,

it's become my sole focus, you know, just telling my life story into this thing and

seeing what comes through. So we'll see how it goes. Anyway, thank you.

Made my way over to Guitar Center and I'm asking the store clerk every time we're taking a clip

just to see what footage I can get. And Guitar Center has a very impressive guitar wall.

This thing goes for a mile. You can see all the guitars back there. They have acoustic room

and all these guitars along here. So Austin is a big music city. I don't think I've ever seen

this many guitars for sale in one store. I remember,

oh I don't know, I think in Vegas. I can't remember the last Guitar Center I was in.

I think it was in Vegas. They had a Guitar Center and all the musical instruments there.

I played the bass guitar a little bit, but I started out in orchestra. So I played the bass

clarinet, which was a rarely needed instrument in orchestra, but it worked really well. The sound

from it was this very low deep bass sound. So I kind of carried that sound over to synthesized

music and then, you know, it influenced all the music I liked listening to, which was

all sorts of techno and dubstep and all the big bassline music. And so that bass clarinet

kind of carried through the whole technological revolution of everything going to synthesizers.

And, you know, having a synthesized bass clarinet sound made it kind of unique. And so I always

thought, you know, it was possible to market that somehow, but I never did. I never actually

made any money other than working as event staff at concerts. I never actually made any money as

a musician other than, you know, in middle school I got really good at music as a kid. And in middle

school I played in orchestra and it like carried me through private school. I ended up going to

private school because I got good at music and it carried me through private school. But once

computers became a thing, you know, everything kind of transferred to computers. So I kind of

fell out of it. I don't know how good I'd be these days. I could probably play, you know,

place clarinet and maybe saxophone, although I'd have to relearn it for the saxophone.

I've never actually handled a saxophone, so I don't know how good I'd be. They have a few

keyboards over here too. And I've always been kind of a Yamaha fanboy. I started out with the

Yamaha motorcycle as a little kid, so Yamaha was like ingrained into my psyche as a small child.

And I love how they make musical instruments too. So Yamaha has been my go-to

brand for anything. And they get their own display, so it appears that I'm not the only

person that likes Yamaha. I did buy a Yamaha R1 motorcycle brand new out of the crate in Las Vegas

10 years ago. I think it was a 2011. I ended up selling it. It was too dangerous to keep riding.

Now I'm thinking, you know, I should have just bought a Yamaha musical instrument instead of a

bike. But going back, you know, as I was talking about the bicycles that have crossed the street,

if it was safer to ride on two wheels, I would be on two wheels all the time.

But with all the cars, you know, it just gets dangerous. And especially with an incredibly

high horsepower motorcycle. I think that thing had 185 horsepower, so it would go

175-180 miles an hour. And having that much power, like it would go 100 miles an hour in first gear.

Having that much power is just unsafe. So I gave up. And maybe I should have just gotten a musical

instrument instead. That might have made more money than that motorcycle. But if I had this

film thing going, then I would have recorded my whole backpack adventure across California,

up PCH, and then back across the Sierra Nevada Mountains, down through Nevada. And

that was my big road trip on that bike. And I'm glad I sold it, because I'm still alive and

not injured. But it was a lot of fun when I had the thing. So that was my big Yamaha story.

Anyway, thank you.

Once again slept for two or three hours. You know, I think I had two beers and went to sleep

and now can't get back to sleep. Woke up at 10 p.m. can't get back to sleep.

Woke up with like tremors or dreams or whatever you want to call them of not having enough money.

So, you know, like you saw earlier, I went to four stores today. Don't have enough money.

I'm standing on the side of the road again. I think I have $14 total to my name.

I'm looking for job opportunities anywhere and everywhere. The other option, you know, there were

two, not one, but two Cybertrucks sitting in the parking lot of those stores I was at.

And, you know, it's an impressive vehicle. It's bigger than you'd expect it to be.

And it looks good. It's still a little, like the first time I saw one, it looked a little

bit like a ripoff of a DeLorean, but in person, you know, it's not quite as DeLorean looking.

Anyway, speaking of employment, I shouldn't bad mouth that thing too much

because speaking of employment and all my history in aviation and space

and the Tesla Gigafactory just outside of Reno, Nevada,

you know, maybe there's a job opportunity at SpaceX or Tesla. I don't know. I have no

transportation whatsoever, so I can't really go to either one of them. SpaceX would be the

I think more greased wheel direction. You know, I don't know how much money Tesla is making, but

SpaceX, you know, having that big Starship, that has got to be pulling some cash in.

So SpaceX would be my preference to work for. I don't know how to get down there to get an

interview because I'm completely stuck in this spot. So it's not the easiest situation to get

out of to go get a job. And like I have maybe three stores that are walking distance from here,

but it doesn't seem like I'm going in the right direction with all three of them. So I'm trying

to get this mulch through as quickly as I can as to which direction I'm supposed to go in, you know.

Like I said before, I'm well endowed. So working for a conventional retailer,

it seems to like fumble up after a few months. There are bars nearby

down along the coast. I could go work for one of them and be close to SpaceX.

But working for SpaceX itself, you know, this is a pretty difficult situation to just jam right in there

and work. And, you know, the only job I could probably get with it is just a janitor

or some really basic low-end job. I don't know how to proceed.

I'm just standing out here fishing for donations. It's not the easiest, you know,

road to go on from this position. So I can't, if I had a car or had transportation,

I could go down to Boca Chica and try to interview down there and see if there's a job available.

But without transportation, I can't do anything. I can't go anywhere.

So I'm stuck in this spot. Anyway, thank you.

Made my way back over to Precision Camera.

And even the used camcorders, in order to get a camera that focuses, the price skyrockets.

So this one is a Panasonic and they want $1,500 for it.

And it's used. And those are all the used camcorders.

They have a whole row of used equipment here.

These are all the other used cameras.

It's just those camcorders because I'm doing this TikTok clips.

But it's a shame. You know, this cell phone was $80.

And it mostly does its job except for the random going out of focus for no reason.

So in order to make the next jump on this thing, I would have to go up in price.

You know, once again, don't have any money.

But would have to go in price up to $1,500.

Or some of these others maybe, all right, there's one for $400.

But even still, you know, it's a lot more money for one of these camcorders.

I'm going to keep like trying to get this Motorola to work.

I don't know if the more expensive Motorola stylus,

because they have like a $300 Motorola stylus.

This is just the 2023.

I don't know if the newer one has a better camera on it.

That wouldn't go out of focus quite as much.

But this poor thing in low light just doesn't want to.

I think I get pretty close to a good quality video if it would stop going out of focus.

So that's what I'm working on.

Anyway, thank you.

Here I am back on the side of the road. I ran out of food and money again.

All I bought this time I think was Mountain Dew Hot Pockets. I got a hot dog from 7-Eleven.

Pasta from Walmart. I don't know. I think that's about it. I'm not vaping as much as I was,

so that's gone down considerably. I'm trying to cycle it out completely,

but you know, just having a vice is having a vice. As far as looking for work,

I started looking back at the cattle ranches and Austin Gamblers, which is a rodeo,

the rodeo team in Austin, and those are two other areas I'm partially qualified for.

I had like 15 cows as a kid and

when I turned like 11 or 12, we ended up moving down to Arizona and I didn't go out to that ranch

much after that. But I do have some cattle experience, so I'm not very afraid of cows is

what it boils down to. You have to be careful around them, but because I was around them so

much as a small child, you know, I got used to having cows there. And looking at cattle ranches

in Texas, you know, they have those big overgrown ones, but a little small one, you put a single

wide trailer on 50, 100 acres and just haul hay out for the cows is all that thing really is.

And you could get 20, 30 cows going pretty easily. And you know, all that thing is,

is you haul the calves out to the pasture and then haul hay out for them and sit out there and wait

for them to grow up. And then once they get to a certain weight, you sell them at auction and it

makes money. So I've done that before. It is preferable to not have to haul too much hay, but

I don't know what the ground looks like out here. In Nevada, we had to haul hay quite a bit.

So it did work. I don't know how much money we made off the thing. And there's other livestock

you could get out there on just a small little 50, 100 acre parcel like goats, sheep, chickens,

turkeys, I don't know, all sorts of livestock that you could then sell. You know, you can sell the

eggs from the chicken, meat from the turkeys, goat milk, you know, you can sell goat milk

and the sheep, I don't know. So it does make money if you keep the overhead really small.

So like cheap little 50, 100 acre land out in the middle of nowhere and the cheapest little

single wide trailer parked on the thing. And it would probably turn a profit just because the

overhead is so low that, you know, it doesn't cost much to keep it running. And when we did this in

Nevada, we had a cheap little international one ton truck that we would haul cows back and forth

from the property. And it would only haul like two or three at a time. So it,

you know, we would take two or three to auction and that was it. It was a really small ranch,

but it was cheap. And what kept it going was everything about it was so inexpensive

that it was able to turn a profit just because, you know, you didn't spend a lot of money on

stupid junk that didn't make any sense being out there, like big tractors and trailers.

And I don't know what else people spend too much money on for cattle. Horses, you know,

having a bunch of horses out there doesn't make any money. So that would be the way to turn a

profit with one. It's been a few years since I handled bales of hay and the whole process of

the thing, but I still remember it. So it might be money. I don't know where to get my foot in

the door. I was thinking about busting over to the Austin Gamblers, their rodeo thing,

and hustling around there and see if I could get my foot in the door,

just to get a start back in this cattle ranching thing. So we'll see how it goes. Anyway, thank you.

Still having a sporadic sleep schedule. So, you know, once again I slept maybe 6 p.m. to like

8 or 9 and then went back to sleep at 4 and woke up at 7 just now. And I'm having all sorts of

weird dreams while I'm trying to sleep. Pretty close to nightmares and they're extremely vivid.

So the latest one, the one that woke me up this morning, was this probably adult, although

looked pretty much like a kid, with a stick pushing on my throat saying I was already dead.

And I told him he was soon to be dead and then I woke up. So I don't know who that or what that

dream is. Obviously, it's uncomfortable having a stick pushed on your throat, you know, with

someone saying you're already dead. So it was an extremely vivid dream. I don't know. These

damn things are keeping me up at night and I'm just trying to sleep like everyone else.

So as soon as I get through this hurdle, I'll be on to the next one. But it's a royal pain

getting through to just being a conventional employee. So anyway, thank you.

So I'm standing out back on the side of the road again. I was playing Doom earlier and can't sleep

at all. You know I slept most of the day like random sporadic sleep schedule. So can't sleep

at all. So I'm up at night. And there's people around a little bit. This is a pretty popular

corner. So I'm standing out here trying to figure out what footage to get. You know

there's there's recordable content everywhere. But like this police car for instance. But

I don't know how to get the best ratings. You know I'm I'm still working on ratings on this

thing. I started going live. So I've been doing like two or three live shows a day where I'm

just answering questions. And they've been going for I don't know I think a few of them

were 35 minutes. One was 55 minutes. So I just sit there and answer questions as people ask.

And then I did two tonight of just me playing Doom which didn't get the best ratings. You know

sitting there playing Doom and people watching it not the best ratings. Me telling stories

are considerably better better for getting ratings. But I'm still kind of stuck in the Doom

spell. So when I wake up you know I want to play a little Doom. Which you know it's not the end of

the world. I'll play for like an hour or something and then get tired of it. But that's the last of

my video games. You know I used to play video games all the time. And the last of all my video

games is the little one hour Doom. So it's it's the end of an era of video games. I'm just too

old for them I think. Which is a shame you know because when I was younger I used to say you know

I want to play video games. I got older because they would keep my mind sharp. I'd be able to

think more clearly if I'm solving all the puzzles in games. But you know once you once you actually

get older then you know the motivation to play them starts to shrink. So I don't know. I maybe

if I start some more puzzle-y kind of thought-provoking games I'll do better at it.

But poor Doom is fading out you know. I played it. I played through it. Played through Doom 1,

Doom 2, all the expansions. I kind of did everything Doom is and it might just be the

the end of an era for it. So I'm gonna stand out here for a little while just walk around see if

any footage whatsoever comes up. There's plenty of people outside so something something recordable

may may present itself and I'll try to record it on here and upload it and

get a bunch of views. So anyway thank you.

So I made my way downtown, took the bus down, used some of the donated money, anyway thank

you again for the donations, used some of the donated money to buy a bus ticket, and

I'm trying to get footage downtown just to put on this channel.

Here's one thing of interest, it's the interior of the capital of Texas. So you can see it

goes up pretty far. I'm on the second floor of the thing, I'm trying not to film anyone

too close. But there it is downstairs. I mean I could do a full walking tour of this thing,

it's gigantic. This is the biggest state capitol building I've ever been in. And it has all

former politicians pictures on the wall. I initially came in, because I rode the bus

down, and I hadn't used the restroom. And I'm like, well, I don't know where the nearest

restroom is around here. So I hopped off the bus and walked around the capitol, and then

gave up and decided I'll just go in the capitol building. Went through security and am now

in the capitol building, and I couldn't resist the opportunity to upload a video. I wish

I had more footage or more content to put on here, because this was kind of an impromptu

visit to the capitol building. But because there was such a crowd going in anyway, it

didn't seem like it would be that big of an issue to walk in and see the building for

what it is. I'm trying not to get in any yelling matches with politicians as much as possible,

but sure enough, the first thing that happens when I go downtown is I'm suddenly in the

capitol building. So I'm going to walk around a little bit outside. Maybe I can get a live

feed going somewhere down here. I do have Wi-Fi connection in this capitol building,

so I may be able to get a live stream going in here. I haven't tried yet. I'm trying not

to film anyone without their authorization as much as possible. Anyway, thank you.

So, like I said, I took the bus downtown and now I'm just looking for footage wherever it comes up.

I made it down to one of the bars down here.

I'm going to have to look up the name, you know, I just wandered in here randomly.

It looked like there was a band setting up, so I decided to upload a clip.

I've been to Sixth Street quite a few times.

And here it is on a Sunday afternoon, pretty quiet.

But I like Sixth Street.

It reminds me of every little downtown bar strip in the West I've ever been to.

So this is a great one.

I really like Austin, as I've said before, so I'm pretty happy to be here.

Once my face clears the rest of the way, I'm going to be seeking A1 hiring.

I'm going to say hi to everyone up and down Sixth Street and see what comes up.

Anyway, thank you.

Decided to do a street pan around with this thing.

There's bands playing, all sorts of stuff going on.

I'm standing in front of the Comedy Mothership, which appears to be closed.

I don't know if they're going to open, but I haven't seen stand-up comedy in a long time.

So, anytime's a good time for stand-up comedy.

There's a few places down here that has stand-up comedy.

I haven't been down here in a while, so I can't remember all of them.

I'm going to keep walking around.

I'm trying not to walk this thing into traffic while I hold it out.

I'm going to keep walking around and see what footage I can find while I'm downtown for a few hours.

I have to be careful, because the bus schedule changes on Sundays.

I've gotten myself stranded down here before, where I had to stay the night.

It's not all bad, though.

The last time I got stranded down here, I just sat on my phone on the Wi-Fi all night.

I ended up ordering a Cash App card, and that's the same Cash App card I'm using now.

I ordered it and had it mailed to the hotel while sitting here, and that became my new donation system.

It may not be all bad to get stranded, but it's kind of a pain getting stuck down here all night.

The buses won't start running again until like 7 a.m., and you're stuck awake all night sitting downtown.

Anyway, thank you.

So as you can see, I made my way down to Coyote Ugly on 6th Street. And it's quiet on Sunday,

so everyone's just hanging around. And I don't know, you know, I could do another pan-around

at the bar. Coyote Ugly has always been one of my favourite bars. I've been to, I was

there for the opening for the one in Las Vegas and went to the one in Florida. I can't remember

where else. I went to the Vegas one a lot though. That was a big part of my Vegas bar

scene was Coyote Ugly there. And this Austin one is great too. I've been in here before

when it was busier. You know, Friday and Saturday nights it's pretty busy. But on Sunday

midday, you know, it's pretty quiet. So I do like it here. This would be another, you

know, when my face clears too. Try and find a job. This might be an option. So anyway,

thank you.

I'm standing in front of the University of Texas at Austin campus.

And I've worked for these colleges before. Well, one college.

I worked for Boise State University as event staff for a year, year and a half.

And finally had to leave. You know, I had my fellow Boise.

So I ended up leaving.

But I got swept up in that Sidney Sweeney-Glenn Powell fiasco they had, you know, from reading the news.

And apparently Sidney was engaged to an Italian guy and then cheated on him with Glenn Powell,

who was her co-worker on the set of Anywhere But You or Anything But You.

I can't remember the name of the movie. But, you know, he was the co-worker on this movie.

And they ended up having an affair.

And while in Vegas, you know, this is very similar to one of my ex-girlfriends in Vegas.

While in Vegas, I was working for Circuit City.

And one of my co-workers, who appears to be very similar to Sidney Sweeney,

I ended up having, well, it wasn't quite an affair because I wasn't seeing anyone.

But we ended up dating while working.

And I don't know what this dating a co-worker thing is.

I didn't, you know, it's not the type of thing you intend to happen.

And it just happened for me.

And we ended up living together for four years and had a bunch of parties.

It was fun. But then she ended up cheating on me with another guy.

And I found out about it on the computer.

Because someone sent me an email or a message on Myspace, I think, saying she had cheated.

And so I broke up with her.

I got really upset and broke up with her and told her to leave the house.

Because I thought at the time her other boyfriend was going to show up and be mad at me for some reason.

So I broke up with her, just cold, all at once.

And never went back.

Never looked back.

Didn't even bother trying to restart the thing.

Because apparently it was so much cheating that it wasn't even worth bothering.

I don't know what mechanism those girls run on.

But this Sidney Sweeney one seems to be very similar.

And that brings up the next problem.

Because I'm doing this TikTok page so much and trying to get a paycheck, wherever that is.

Whether it's acting, film production, studio work, whatever.

Whatever's a paycheck.

The story behind that Vegas party of me dating a co-worker at Circuit City and then having a bunch of house parties with her.

Behind the back of the company I was working for.

Because all of this was hidden.

And we would have huge house parties with half the store there.

And it stayed like a secret somehow for the longest time.

So it made really good house parties.

I'll put it that way.

But it's very similar to this Sidney Sweeney thing.

And you can make a movie out of it.

And probably make some money.

Because it's another one of these huge Vegas party stories.

And that was the big event I had in Vegas with one of those Sidney Sweeney types.

She had other problems.

She had a few tattoos when I started dating her.

And then she started getting herself covered in tattoos.

And the cheating.

And she had a tendency to be racist.

Although I don't think she was trying to be racist.

She just had tendencies to be racist.

And that was a problem for me because I like all types of people.

I don't care what they are. I like people.

So that was another big issue with that one.

But it was a good party in my mid-twenties.

That was a very good party.

And I'm glad I did it when I did.

And I'm glad I'm not looking back now.

I don't know. If you could develop this story more.

You might be able to get a movie out of that one Vegas party alone.

And I had a few others after that.

That was just one of them.

There were like four other girlfriends that were big parties as well.

Anyway, thank you.

So I tried to do a live stream from here and I was connected to the Denny's Wi-Fi which is right

across the street or right across the parking lot and apparently it kept lagging out so I had to

give up. I'm trying to do an outdoor live but because I don't have data on the cell phone

it's close to impossible you know just connecting to open Wi-Fi. None of it is reliable enough to

to be able to get a stream going. So I'm sitting out here where the where the

day laborers are just seeing if any employment presents itself. I don't know I'll probably be

out here for a little bit. I was hoping to get to interview people but it it may not happen.

It's pretty difficult you know there's a communication barrier. So I'm trying to get

some interviews going on here but it has to be interesting interviews you know.

If it's if it's not interesting you know it's not worth putting up there in the first place.

So like I said not a lot going on today. Looking for work same as always. Anyway thank you.

I think I'm sitting at $16 total in my cash app and nothing in my PayPal.

So I'm pretty close to out of money again.

What I bought is I bought that jock itch spray and ringworm cream and Mountain Dew, hot dogs, ramen noodles, pasta, let's see what else, Pringles chips, I don't know.

A few banquet TV dinners. I think that's it from the last donation.

So now I'm getting close to out of money again and preparing for the next time.

I have to stand out here where the cardboard is for some reason.

You know, I just tried where all the day laborers was and it didn't work.

You know, I can't quite get in that spot.

So I'm stuck with the cardboard for the time being.

And that's my only source of income.

I wish, you know, there's probably room to make more money in this spot.

I just don't know how.

Like if you dress in outfits, play music, I don't know, all sorts of different ideas come to mind.

But I don't know, you know, I don't know how much I'm willing to invest in it.

Because potentially when my face clears, I'll just get like right in the next year, whatever that is, wherever the next bracket get moved right into it.

So I don't know how long I'm going to be in this spot.

But as for right now, this is where I am.

It's not the worst, you know.

Still, even begging on the side of the road with a sheet of cardboard is not the worst position you can be in.

So I'm grateful for what I have.

Anyway, I'm going to go back up to the hotel room and upload this thing and see if I can get a live stream going.

Anyway, thank you.

Made my way back to Coyote Ugly, and it's quiet, you know, some of the bars further on 6th are busier than this one.

But it's still going, you know, there's people in here. I'm still looking for the best employment options, and this might be it.

Like I said before, I was there for the Las Vegas opening at New York New York, and there was a line like the whole way around the building to get into Coyote Ugly when it opened in Vegas.

So this Austin one, you know, it's not as big as the Vegas one, but it's still nice. You know, I like it here too.

I'm pretty happy this place is here. I hope it stays here for quite a while. It's the bar I'm going to be at for tonight at least.

I purposely stranded myself downtown because the buses don't run at night. So I'll be stuck here till like 530.

I don't know. I'm going to try to get footage throughout the night of events going on. You know, there's all sorts of stuff going on on 6th Street, so there's going to be something of interest.

I'll try to get some interviews in. I'm having trouble getting interviews. So I'm going to keep working on it just to get interesting interviews on this channel, which hasn't happened yet. You know, it's just me talking about whatever.

So anyway, thank you.

Well, someone just backed into a squad car right next to me, so I'm trying to pan around and get footage of it.

I don't know what happened there, but that white van just backed into that police car, and now they're assessing damage.

I wish I got footage. I didn't have my camera out, but I would have filmed it to see...

I would have seen the loud crunching sound as it backed into it, but now they have like four squad cars out, and I don't know, they were here for another stop, but he backed right into that squad car, so they haven't gotten out of the car yet.

What's up? Yeah, I wonder if he's drunk. You know, he might be a drunk driver, so they haven't even gotten out to respond to that van backing into him, but it's nice having the police presence here.

I like anywhere with a police presence. I think I've said this before, but I have been to the... Well, I'm from the absolute ghetto, so the police are a welcome asset to anywhere I want to be.

If you're from the bottom and law-abiding, then having the police there is the most wonderful thing. So anyway, I'll keep a camera on these cars to see what happens. Thank you.

Velvet Taco was nice enough to let me use their Wi-Fi. I showed up right as I think they were

closing or closing up shop at least and asked the employees if I could sit on the Wi-Fi because

apparently the buses no longer run at night. And the only way I could go to Coyote Ugly at the

time I wanted to be there was to just either ride a night bus back or be stuck downtown for the

night till 5 30 or something. So I unfortunately got stuck. So now I'm stuck downtown. It's not

the worst thing in the world. I did get to talk to people in Coyote Ugly which was my intention.

I hope one of these opportunities pans into something. But as for now, I'm stuck downtown.

It's not the worst. I do have Wi-Fi and a full battery for this phone so I can just sit on TikTok

all night. I wish I could do a live stream. Once again, the wireless network here is also too slow

for doing live so I can only do these pre-recorded clips. But it is pretty empty out here right now.

I'm probably going to walk around in an hour and see if there's anything of interest

around. There's a park south of here with a lake. Downtown is pretty big in Austin so

it's a fun place to be. And at night, you know, it's not the end of the world getting

stranded down here because you have most of the thing to yourself so you can just walk around

and not be in anyone's way. I always feel like during the day I'm in everyone's way

and trying not to be. So I really like this town.

I'm gonna see if any footage appears and try to upload it. Thank you!

I've been going through what's slowing me down from working, and mostly it's this face.

So, you know, everyone has their problems. My face is mine, and I have, you can see the

acne that's still there, a few spots, and then I have all the scarring from where it

was. And on the other side, there's scarring there too. So, I have a few scars on my cheek

that's pretty ingrained in there. What caused this is when I was homeless, I couldn't take

a shower for the longest amount of time, and I had a bunch of acne before becoming homeless.

And it was small, and I squeezed it, you know, just out of stupid habit, I would just squeeze

them and then go back to playing video games or whatever. But when I couldn't take a shower

and I was sleeping in the dirt for years, it caused it all to come to the surface and

swell. And some of them got so big, you know, I had the size of golf balls on my face. And

I got them all clear. This one was gigantic. It was the biggest one. I have all of them.

I got it, you know, like all the infections to stop coming up. And I've been using Neutrogena

three times a day for the past six months, and it's still just going like this. So, once

this thing clears completely, I should be okay. I don't know what to do about these scars on my

neck, though. I'm trying to tan over them. You know, I'm thinking if I just sit in the sun long

enough, I'll get them tanned over enough where they won't show. But this is what I am left with

with my face. And this is all the damage, quote unquote, that I took was just my face. You know,

everything else is fine. It's just my face got infected from not getting to take showers for

two years. And I should be able to get the last of it out. I don't know. Everyone's like a face

expert on TikTok, and I'm not, as you can tell. You know, as you can tell by how my face looks

and how everyone else's face looks. So, that's part of what motivated me to start a TikTok

account in the first place is just if I could get my face clear, you know, that would be awesome.

So, anyway, thank you.

So I made my way back down to 6th Street.

And it's getting late.

Now there's a few people out, but it's not that busy.

Coyote County already closed.

So I was doing a live stream earlier.

I found a pretty good wireless connection.

And did a live stream.

But these videos are getting way more views than the live streams.

So I think the live stream I had like 60 people on there or something.

Whereas this one, you know, this gets more views than the live streams.

I'm going to try to keep the live streams going.

But I have to be careful not to completely gas myself on live streams.

Because you can sit on that thing for hours and just answer questions.

So I'm trying to get these pre-rehearsed ones.

Trying to keep these pre-rehearsed ones going.

And, you know, that fit this form of me talking for five minutes or so.

And having some scene or event going on that people want to see.

So, as you can see, there's a few more people along here.

But it's not the busiest place in the world tonight.

I like it. You know, this is one of my favorite spots.

The only curse I have is there's so many cigarette smokers here.

And I don't want to ever smoke a cigarette again.

I don't want anything to do with them.

So that's the only downside to being down here.

Is I'm trying to avoid anything to do with...

And, you know, I vape now and I don't even want that.

You know, I'll quit that as soon as I possibly can.

So I'm trying to avoid smoking cigarettes altogether.

And there's so many smokers down here that it's not helping.

So, like I said before, you know, I haven't had a cigarette in a few months.

And I want to keep it that way.

So I'm going to keep walking around.

I'll see if any footage comes through and upload it on here.

Anyway, thank you and stay tuned.

So what I'm eating, people have been asking me what I'm eating on

from donations, and here's an example. Now without, you know, I'm going through copyright

infringement and what classifies as copyright infringement. If I show an advertisement on

camera, does that classify as copyright infringement? But here is a microwaved

edible. See, I'm trying to figure out what copyright infringement is. And what I have to drink is

this flavored mix juices. So I drink these quite a bit. And I also have, you know, now that we're

back to the world of copyright infringement, a green bottle that has a energy beverage in it.

So I don't know. I've had two violations now regarding copyright infringement.

And both of them, like I had movie posters in the back of one of them, and the other one was

filming the police cars, which I don't know where the copyright violation is, that I was

posting unoriginal content. And I have to post original content. So I'm going through

what, how those violated. I appealed both of those videos, stating that, you know,

having advertisements, which the movie posters were advertisements,

in the video is probably okay, because those are designed to be viewed by the public.

And the video of the police, you know, I don't, I don't see where the copyright infringement

violation is. So now I'm trying to be really careful. Because I only, you know, if I get

hit by five of those things, then I think they, they turn off the creator fund, which would be

bad. So I'm being really careful about what, what classifies as copyright infringement,

and how to avoid it. I'm going to be looking it up all day

to make sure I don't get in violation in any way. Anyway, thank you.

Well, the best I can do, and I have to be quiet because it's the middle of the night, but the

best I can do from this very position, seeking employment at a place that might hire me,

being well endowed, once again, you know, I have to stay close to where the models are or where

that's allowed, but the best I could come up with is, here's a mobile home in Cedar Creek for $20,000.

Then I brought the loan calculator. 10-year loan term is $222 per month.

Five-year is $400 a month, so that depends on how much they pay me. Then I need a car to drive over

there. So a car is, this is the best I could find on Craigslist. It's $5,000 and finance, so I don't

know, another $300 on top of the $200. So I'm spending $500 per month, and then Circuit of the Americas,

because there's models there, I can get hired. I'm learning this as I go along because I

didn't know it was an issue, but apparently, well endowed, you can only be in certain areas,

and there has to be models there. So Circuit of the Americas, which is the big racetrack here,

has 16 job opportunities available, but I need reliable transportation and housing nearby

in order to do that, which is not the easiest. I mean, how am I supposed to cross this hurdle?

I can't get a loan payment without employment, and I can't get employment without a loan,

or I can't get housing nearby and transportation without a loan for the job.

So I don't know how it's expected to do this. I'm going to keep asking on here

for the best path to take, but I'll be standing on the side of the road

asking for donations when I run out of money again, because I cannot path to Circuit of the

Americas with housing nearby and transportation with zero dollars. I don't know if there's a bank

that'll issue a loan. I think I have good credit. I should have pretty good credit to really good

credit. I've never had any outstanding balance on my loan payments. I think I missed one power bill

one time and ended up paying it like six months later, and that's just because I forgot to

pay the power bill when I was moving. So one payment got missed, and I paid it like six months

later, but I've never had a foreclosure or had a car repo or anything like that. So my credit

rating should be really good, but it's still impossible to get over this hurdle because

to get a loan, I need to prove employment, and to prove employment, I need housing and

transportation, and to get housing and transportation, I need a loan. So that's where I'm stuck. Anyway, thank you.

So, sitting outside in the middle of the night, and I'm still working through the sporadic sleep

schedule, but I'm sitting outside because, you know, I can't sit in the hotel room for too long,

so I have to go out somewhere. And so here I am, you know, I walk down the block,

like, I don't know, a couple hundred yards, and sitting out here trying to figure out

what content to create, what stories to tell. I am going live, but it keeps turning into the story

that got me into this situation in the first place. And it involves my parents and my mom

upsetting Washington, D.C., and then fleeing to Nevada and then hiding in the mountains in Nevada,

having me out there, and then my dad receiving money from jobs under the table and probably

not paying taxes on it, or neither was the employer, I don't think. I don't know what

they were doing. This is all baggage that's slowing me down now. So that money she walked

away with could have had back taxes being owed on it, so I'm trying to find the best angle on that

to get taxes paid and get a clean paper trail on everything. So that's what I'm working toward.

As it sits now, you know, I'm stuck awake at night. I'll sleep four hours, wake up,

sleep three hours. So once I get my sleep cycle a little more normal, that'll speed things up.

And as far as, you know, I never had legal representation during my dad's estate closure.

My mom did, I didn't. I didn't have an attorney, so the whole thing just went to her automatically.

I don't know how she rigged that thing in advance to do that. She's one of these, if you've ever

seen the movie Casino, which had like Robert De Niro and I can't remember, Joe Pesci,

I can't remember what the girl's name is.

Anyway, the ginger character. My mom is the epitome of the ginger character from that movie.

She goes around, rips everyone off, gets in trouble, and, you know, gets kicked out of

everywhere. So that's what she is. She tries to cover it. She's like adapted to the situation

to the best of, you know, to cover up all the crimes she's committed. But that movie Casino

and that ginger character and her are one in the same. So I'm going through, like in that movie,

I shouldn't pattern it after that movie, but in that movie, she's trying to go to the feds and

the FBI at the end of the thing because she has then upset everyone in the city of Las Vegas.

So she tries and fails at it and then just, I think, ODs at the end of the thing. But

this is after she successfully like ripped off everyone she ever had any contact with. So I'm

trying to figure out the best legal angle against it to get her to stop doing that. And that

character mold she's found herself in, breaking that track. So that's where I am. I'm gonna sit

outside for a few more minutes, walk around, just cool off, try to clear my head and see if I can

get as much of this resolved as possible. So I am a clean, law-abiding, honest American. Anyway, thank you.

Made my way back to the park and there's a few people walking around.

I did two laps around the thing. My poor boots. I'm wearing these

construction boots and they are showing their wear already.

You know, I've gotten through the tread on these and these were the thickest

tread boots I could buy. So the the tread is going. I'm just

about to the foam. These are steel toe boots too so they're

not the best for walking but they're really rugged.

So they make up for it with ruggedness because

I walk around so much that, you know, those cheap little sneakers

and walking shoes will just disintegrate off my feet. So when I wear actual boots

you know they last a while. Anything with foam soles, you know, I

just chew right through them. It's part of not

having a car, you know. You have to walk so much

that shoes just disintegrate. So even these boots, you know, getting

the tread down to flat, to beyond flat. Now it's

now it's already going into the sole of the shoe.

So I don't know how much longer these boots are going to last.

They have been, they are probably the best shoes I've ever owned.

I got them at Walmart. They're Survivors or something.

Probably the best shoes I've ever owned. Just because they're so tough and so

good at being boots. So I'm pretty impressed

with them. More on my back story. So while I was

in Vegas, you know, going through X's and

all the the mess I got myself into out there.

I used to walk up and down the Vegas Strip

to get exercise. Like that was my spot to get exercise.

So I'm always kind of looking for places to get exercise and this

this park is excellent. This park is better than the Vegas Strip was.

It's just so nice to be here. It's really pleasant.

But that was one of the many, many faults of Las Vegas.

Others were, you know, like everyone was covering themselves in tattoos.

And I have no tattoos whatsoever. So that was causing this kind of

collision where I didn't want to get any tattoos.

You know, I didn't want them. But everyone I knew was getting more and

more tattoos. And that was that was creating this

rift. And the other rift that was created is

everyone was starting to break the law and I wasn't.

You know, I was working really hard to not break the law. So that created another

rift. Those are two of the reasons Vegas

failed. I'm much happier to be in Austin. I

really like Austin. I hope I can make it work here. I'm doing

everything in my power to be part of the community and

be where I'm supposed to be

for employment. So I'm gonna keep walking around this park for

for at least the morning. I don't know when I'll go back. At some point I'll go

back and be back at the hotel.

So anyway, thank you.

So I'm sitting at Alamo Drafthouse, I think is the name of it.

It's a bar near Mueller Lake Park.

And they have stand-up comedy here every Friday night.

But it's like $15-20 to get in, and that's $15-20 I don't have.

So I will not be able to see the stand-up comedy.

But they did let me sit in the bar, and I asked if I could upload a clip.

So I'm just recording a short clip of this bar, which is really interesting.

They have all sorts of paintings on the wall. It looks like a carnival.

There's the stage for the show.

And there's the bar itself.

So it's an interesting little spot.

I've never walked in here before.

It's attached to a movie theater.

And the movie theater is upstairs, and then there's a bar downstairs.

So I didn't know there was a bar here either.

But it's a great little spot.

Coming from the casinos, if I climb straight out, I end up in a carnival somewhere.

So this is another good spot.

Because it's so carnival-themed, you can just kind of transition over to the carnival scene.

Because I'm still going through tax evasion and money received under the table for employment,

and all sorts of pile of baggage of potential crime,

I'm getting completely buried under that.

So everything's stifled.

I can sit at the same level, but I can't really do anything until this entire investigation gets resolved.

So it's nice to get to sit in the bar for a few hours at least.

Or not even a few hours, a few minutes.

And see what it would be.

I don't know if this would be a job opportunity or not.

I've never actually had bartending experience.

I think I went to the bartending school. I can't remember though.

But this does have a restaurant and a dining area.

So potentially I might be able to get employment here.

I have to sit here and wait. I'm still waiting on my face.

It's still got acne on it.

So once that clears up, this will be another possibility for employment.

Anyway, thank you.

So I'm out of food, money, and my cell phone expired.

I think I have $5 left in my Cash App so I can get like a Mountain Dew and other stuff.

But I don't have enough to restart my cell phone service.

So I was going to try to start a Venmo account and just add it to the list in my profile

because I have Cash App and PayPal going in there now.

But I can't start the account because my cell phone expired.

I'm just using Wi-Fi to upload these videos.

I don't have any data whatsoever on this thing.

It's just the basic cell phone number and text messages.

So I don't have enough money to restart the cell phone plan to sign up for the Venmo account.

What I've been buying is basic groceries.

I think I got two sandwiches from HEB, two Mountain Dews, and I got vape.

The last of my bad habits is vape.

I have a case of beer in the fridge, but it's been sitting there for a good week now.

So I haven't been drinking beer that much.

It kind of waves in and out when I want beer and when I don't.

If I have beers for a few days, then I'll go like a week without it.

I don't know what category that puts me in.

I don't think it would be anywhere near a problem to have two beers a night for three

days and then not drink for a week, week and a half.

That's probably about where it should be.

I think I had a McDonald's big breakfast yesterday, but I hadn't had one in like a week.

I've been mostly eating Hot Pockets.

I had ramen noodles.

I don't know what else was in there.

A few salads, a few pasta bowls.

Got those flavored drinks, the really cheap $2 pitcher's worth of beverage flavored mixes.

That's all I've been buying.

Oh, and bus tickets.

I've been buying bus tickets to downtown and to that park.

Mostly walking into businesses to see if I'm in any way employable.

And that's where I'm stuck now.

So out of mind to restart my cell phone service and standing out here on the side of the road

using this digital cardboard for what it's worth.

I'm still going through the best way to do this because this thing is just glorified

digital cardboard.

You can communicate a lot more with a video explanation than a sheet of cardboard.

You know, a sheet of cardboard you can barely say what has landed you in this position because

you can only fit like four words on the thing and all the cars are flying by anyway.

So no one can see what the issue actually is.

Whereas this video one, you know, you get a thorough explanation of everything I've

been through, everything I'm doing, and all my intentions up to this point.

So I really like it for that purpose.

I hope to get through this, you know, as soon as possible to be a productive member

of society.

So anyway, thank you.

Made my way back to Texas Capitol and it's a little quieter today, so I have a little more

time to walk around and film the thing. The dome of this is the most impressive part.

I wish I could walk closer to this railing, but I have vertigo like you wouldn't believe,

so I have to be careful, you know, near railings. And I didn't used to have vertigo,

like one day I just got hit with vertigo and I have no idea where it came from.

But now, you know, I can't go close to railings at heights or anything, so I have to stay back.

But there's what you can see. This is only my second time in here, so I don't know much about

the building. I've been to a few capitals before this. I guess Boise, Carson City, Nevada.

I don't know where else. Washington, D.C. But this is the most impressive of them all.

I do like learning about history and, well, anything I can really learn about, I enjoy.

So this is another thing that's fun to see. I'm gonna walk around downtown today

and see what's going on. But this is a free thing to get into that has some interest to it.

Unfortunately, you know, I don't think you can get in any of the rooms, any of the side rooms.

You can only see the center area. I walked around a little bit and it doesn't look like there's

access to the other, you know, where all their meetings are and stuff. So it would be cool to

be able to sit in one of those. I'm gonna check out the other floors and if there's

anything of interest, I'll film a video and upload it. Anyway, thank you.

Trying to get more sun on my face to clear out this acne.

I went in and bought Neutrogena again with the donations.

The guy gave me this look, you know, like, what am I buying Neutrogena for?

You know, like, it's for kids or something.

And, you know, it's pretty self-explanatory that there's a problem with my face as it is.

But anyway, long story short, here's the outside of this Capitol.

Um, I, uh, I like to wander around here.

It's a nice little park area outside, so I'm going to this park instead for a while.

It does have this, uh, this big beautiful building at the center of it, so.

I, uh, I don't have much of a history of the state Capitol.

Um, I've been down here quite a few times.

It's another, you know, getting out of the hotel room spot.

I did want to say thank you for the donations.

I got, I think, $40 in.

Um, it went to, let's see, $16 or $17 of it went to my cell phone, um, just to get my cell phone working again.

And then, um, uh, $10 went to the bus.

And then, uh, I think $5 went to a pasta bowl in Mountain View.

And so I'm down to $8.

Um, so, uh, it, uh, it didn't last as long as I was hoping.

It was the cell phone that really hurt the poor thing.

Usually I try to make donations last as long as possible, but, uh, that's, that's why I got it with this round.

So thank you again for the donations.

Uh, I'll be bankrupt here in an hour again, too.

So, uh, you'll see me uploading a clip out of money.

I don't have a better solution for this.

Um, if I had a better solution, I would be using it.

Um, I just, all I can do is really protest on my cell phone, uh, my situation and hope that the right people are, are watching and listening to resolve, uh, that mile of 50-year-old baggage crime

that, uh, that occurred in Nevada and who knows where else, probably Washington, D.C. as well, um, that was never addressed.

And now it all landed on me.

And everyone likes to say that, you know, because it wasn't me who committed any of the crimes, I'm not responsible for it.

Well, I am responsible for it.

Um, it was my parents that did it and I inherited it.

And in my mom's case, she's still doing it.

So, uh, I have to make up for her doing it currently and, uh, resolve or pay off any, uh, backlog of taxes and fraud and crime that was committed, um, on my parents' behalf.

So, uh, yes, it did inherit down to, uh, to me.

Um, I, and the worst part of it is I don't get to see any money out of it.

It's just the crime.

Uh, so anyway, it's, it's as frustrating as can be.

I'm gonna keep explaining this over and over again until it's resolved.

Anyway, thank you.

So I made my way down to the hotel gym. I used to go to the gym quite a bit in Vegas at LVAC,

but I haven't been to one in a long time and I can't remember the equipment that well.

The only thing I would use is dumbbells and they don't have them. So,

you know, maybe I could work on cardio. I don't know. I'm not in the worst shape. I'm not in

the best shape, but maybe I could work on cardio. I'm finding myself walking around

too much. So now I'm back to the just endless walking around. It kind of burns off like angst

and aggression and anything that would make me yell, for instance, which works. You know, it's

just simple and works. So I've been walking around. I could try to use the gym equipment,

but it's not the best footage in the world. You know, the best footage is out there.

So I wish, you know, I would be using those free weights right now if they had them.

I saw there was a another gym down the road, like 42 minutes away. So I 42 minute walk,

it's a six minute drive, a 42 minute walk. So I may walk down there just to see it.

I always did enjoy the gym because you could just put music on and kind of work out until you're

tired and feel better when you get back. So, like I said, I'm not in the worst shape anyway.

I've been trying to do, trying to set my diet correctly so that I'm eating healthy food

and not going to McDonald's. You know, it was, it was just, it's expensive. I can't go over to

Walmart or H-E-B and get healthier food for less money. So I'm probably avoiding fast food for now,

despite the ease of it. Cause you know, Walmart is, it's probably not half a mile, but a quarter.

It's a good walk away. And McDonald's is like right next door. So McDonald's is a really short

walk and Walmart is considerably longer one. And how I've been getting my groceries or how I was

getting my groceries before is I just put my backpack on and then fully load the thing with

groceries and then hike it all back. And it's a, it's a big backpack. So I could haul a week's

worth of food with the thing. But once I started this donations thing, I'm trying to get myself

in the right bracket, meaning I'm eating the right food groups and getting plenty of exercise and not

sitting in the hotel too much. So I've just been getting one or two little things when I shop,

rather than getting a week's worth of food at a time. So I'm going to keep working on diet and

fitness. I'm probably going to walk on the sidewalk anyway, just to see the, see the outdoors rather

than getting cooped up in this little gym, at least. If this was a bigger gym, I would probably

work out in it, but because it's so small and there's only like three things I never use,

I'll, I'll go outside for my exercise. Anyway, thank you.

So I ran both of my credit cards empty. I have a cash app that's at zero dollars and like no cents.

And my PayPal's at like three dollars, I think. I don't know specifically. I think three dollars. It's not much.

And I have eight dollars and quarters, which was for laundry, but it'll go to food if needed.

I'm sitting out at a different spot now. I was going to go all the way downtown, but the buses stopped running on Sunday night.

And I didn't feel like getting stranded the night. I just felt like walking around a little bit to cool down.

I've been sitting in that hotel room and it, you know, after a while, you can only sit in there for so long.

It's a small room, so I had to go walk around. I did, with the money I got, I got pasta and tuna and a sandwich and a Mountain Dew.

And some of that orange flavored mix juice stuff. So I think that was all with the last round of donations.

Thank you very much. I did sign up for a Venmo account. I think that's how it's pronounced.

I got the whole thing running, but I won't see the card until September 20th. So the money's kind of stuck in there.

I don't know. There's probably a way to get to transfer. You know, if I receive donations to the Venmo, there's probably a way to transfer it to another account.

I couldn't find it very easily. It's got to be in there somewhere.

So now I'm sitting, I have three debit cards, which is interesting to say the least.

I don't have an actual bank. You know, I just use these online debit cards.

But someone always comes along and says they have this different card and they would donate if I had an account with whatever that is.

So I keep signing up for them so I have the right accounts. And that's why I ended up with three debit cards.

I should get my PayPal or TikTok monthly check on the 15th, which this month was pretty good.

It's I think it's $440, but that doesn't do me any good right now.

I was making a little bit with live, but that seems to have jammed up again.

You know, I had live working for a while and now it's jammed up again.

So I think I just ran out of stuff to say on live. It's just not enough interesting content to keep it going.

So I made, you know, 80 bucks off of it, which was pretty good.

And that was just from the TikTok side. There were a few donations out of it, too.

So it's going pretty well. I'm not spending much, you know, I'm not.

I haven't bought any new clothes, any new shoes.

All I bought is food, you know, I'm just buying food with donations.

Oh, and the bus ticket and the cell phone. I spent $16 on a cell phone.

So I have another month of cell phone service. But that's all I'm spending these donations on.

So thank you very much. I have once again gone bankrupt.

So any help would be appreciated. Once again, thank you.

So I only stayed down at HEB for like an hour or so. For some reason I'm thinking, you know,

I shouldn't go to that park too much. So I ended up coming back to Norwood, where I am,

and I went and sat out by Walmart on the Wi-Fi and sat on TikTok, and then walked back to the

hotel room, ate some pasta, went back to Walmart, sat on TikTok. I'm having trouble getting TikTok

working in the hotel room. For one reason it's stuttering, and another reason it just feels like

it's like completely pinned down. Like it just, it's hard to get to flow, I guess would be the

way to describe it correctly. Whereas the Walmart, you know, when I connect to Walmart Wi-Fi it just

goes like no other. So I ended up wanting to sit outside at Walmart just to be able to sit on TikTok

and get the whole Walmart vibe, you know, on TikTok, which is, I don't know, more entertaining.

Anyway, thank you for the donations. I received a few donations from last video. I think I'm

sitting at, I have three dollars in my Cash App, and four dollars in my PayPal, and then eight

dollars and quarters. And that's all, all the money I have. So it's not, it's not like I'm

raking it in, but it is helpful. It is getting me food, and I'm trying to get everything sorted.

I don't know if I already said, you know, the neighbor's slamming around next door in the hotel room.

He's been slamming around all night, so I'm having trouble getting any rest in there.

So now I'm out walking around. I thought, you know, at the beginning of the night I was just

going to ride the bus all the way downtown and just be stranded downtown for the night,

just to cool off and walk around and try to come up with video ideas and all of that.

But I decided to come back instead. Now I'm just kind of wandering around out here.

I got a really good night's sleep. After being at the Capitol and recording two videos

out front of the Capitol, I, you know, my sleep cycle like crashed the other way.

And I got a really good night's sleep, but I woke up like with the pillow

full of sweat. So I was sweating in my sleep for some reason. I don't know what that is, and I was

snoring some. I'm still going through what's causing my sleep issues. I work on exercise.

I work on diet. I'm talking to staff of various businesses all over the place, but nothing,

you know, the door hasn't quite opened anywhere. So I'm still waiting for that door opening. You

know, you talk to the staff for a while, you get to know each other, and then you see if they're

hiring. Well, I haven't gotten through the first step of talking to the staff and getting to know

each other. So once I get through that, then it's a pleasure. And I don't know what's in the way.

Either it's me or all this. You know, I used to have a lot of belongings, a lot of houses,

a lot of cars, a lot of possessions. And I have nothing now. And I didn't really spend anything.

You know, it wasn't like I did anything to bankrupt myself. So that flags a lot of alarms.

And that's what's causing, that's at least what's causing some hesitation,

at least on my part. Like there's no way to resolve it. There's no way to

remedy it. You know, it's just everything's gone. And I didn't do anything. So

that, you know, it's surprising to see this situation. If I look at from a third-party

perspective, you know, it's going from really wealthy to really poor without doing anything,

you know, without doing anything wrong, just working and everything just kind of vanishing.

So I'm still trying to protest my case on here to see if anything comes through

to resolve it. It all started, you know, when my dad lost the ranch. He had a ranch in northern

Nevada, and someone bought it out from under him. That's when the whole thing started to cascade.

And everything in Nevada is a house of cards. So one thing goes down, all of it goes down.

And when that went down, the whole thing just started to cave in. And that caved in like

everything I was doing, everything he had done. And my mom conveniently ended up with all the

money. So that's how that went. It's difficult. You know, it's like getting robbed and then being

told to just go work somewhere and not think about it. You know, just like don't bring it up.

So that's an issue too. These are what's running through my head right now.

I'm going to keep chipping away at it and find the best path to take.

Any ideas would be appreciated. Anyway, thank you.

So with my sleep cycle all over the place, you know,

it gives me a lot of time to think. And, uh, uh, part of, you know,

avoiding danger is a big, uh,

big deal these days. You know, before when I was in my twenties,

um, I would, uh, you know, race around on motorcycles,

fly around in little airplanes. Um, I don't know,

pick up whatever girl was nearby and, uh, uh,

drink on the Vegas strip excessively. So that was, that was my twenties.

Um, I, uh, I don't know, I got older.

I got a little more cautious and being, and trying to undo all this crime.

Now, because I was born in crime, um,

trying to, I started trying to undo it when I was 30. So, uh,

uh, during my twenties, you know, I was really wild and had too much fun.

Um, then during my thirties, I tried to, you know, be career oriented.

The second I tried to start an actual career,

the whole thing caved in because there was so much crime that it just,

it didn't hold, you know,

I had to go back through and explain, uh,

unreported income back taxes and, and where money was received.

So, uh, uh,

that's what like caused my entire operation to cave in,

which was just a little it, uh, network administrator kind of business thing.

Um, but anyway, trying to stay safe now and avoid danger.

Um, seeing some of the girls on here are really attractive,

but, uh, uh, I don't know, you know,

I don't have any real STDs and this has been on my mind.

You know, I don't have, I have like,

I got a cold sore two years ago and, um, uh,

that jock itch ringworm is still there. You know, I'm spraying it down. Uh,

I'm just about out of the jock itch spray, but I'm spraying it down. You know,

it's getting less and less slowly, but surely, but you know,

you have to take a lot of that stuff on to get rid of it.

So even jock itch and I got jock itch from this native American woman,

in my twenties. So, uh, uh, it's a lot of work just for,

and that's just jock itch. You know, it's not even that big of a STD,

if it even classifies as an STD. So, uh,

I'm really concerned about catching something and, uh,

that combined with not having any money whatsoever has put me in the no chance

category where I just don't have a chance with a girl. I'm too paranoid and,

uh, uh, I'm not communicating correctly and

I'm avoiding danger so much that it's just like locking me in a box

and, uh, I had a fourth one. I can't remember.

Uh, say I don't want to catch anything.

Anyway, I can't remember. Um, Oh,

and I don't want to get in fights with like siblings, relatives,

family members, you know, any of that over some girl. So, you know,

I'm too old for that now too, which, uh, Oh,

I remember the last thing because I undid all the crime,

uh, involving my parents, you know,

all the women I once had a chance with,

I now no longer have a chance with because there's no crime for it to run on.

Um, so having all that undone kind of ruined my chances with the,

the same women. And I have to like get in a different,

a different pool to have a chance with anyone. So as it sits right now, you know,

I just don't have a chance with, with anyone, uh, until, you know,

I get in a, a law abiding legal system

which, uh, you know, like I said before, I've never been arrested.

All of this was my parents stuff that I'm still trying to undo. Um,

so, uh, getting into the right system, you know,

now I have to go through once I get jock, it's clear.

I have to be in the right spot for the well in doubt thing.

And then being in the right spot for the bone doubt thing, I can't catch anything.

You know, I have to avoid all STDs. So it's a,

it's like a really difficult situation. Um,

I'm going to keep uploading on here telling my life story.

I still don't have much money. You know, I think I have $2 in my cash app,

$4 in my PayPal and $8 and quarters. So that's where I'm at on money.

I had a Mountain Dew last night eating pasta.

I have the one last little bit of pasta in the can of tuna fish for food and,

uh, uh, just trying to get by. So, uh,

anyway, thank you.

Thank you for the donations. I think I got 20 bucks in, maybe 25. I bought two Mountain Dews,

a salad, and that discount sushi from HEB, and some of the jock itch spray. So that's what I

got with the donations. I got another ten dollars in my Venmo account, so thank you very much for

that, but it's jammed in the Venmo account. I can't get the transfer over. I was trying to

transfer it to my Cash App, because I won't get the Venmo card until the 20th, so I'm still

waiting on that one, but I wanted to try it out. You know, it's another easy way to get donations,

so I put that account on there as well, but you know, it's jammed. I'm going to keep trying to

get the transfer over. I might be able to use the card number directly from the app, or pay

directly from the app, and use it that way, so I'll keep messing around with it, but I'm back

to out of money. It wasn't much, and I got dinner out of it, so I'm happy with that. I have been

going to HEB instead of Walmart. I was going to Walmart before, but now I'm going to HEB.

So I like to think I'm climbing up through social infrastructure,

but HEB has a better produce section, you know, where I'm getting the

stuff you don't have to prepare, you just have, or you can just eat without preparations.

So that's why I've been buying. Anyway, all donations are appreciated. Thank you.

So I ran out of money again. I can't remember what I bought last with it. I don't know,

like a Mountain Dew and a bag of Doritos. Thank you for the donations. But, you know,

this forced me to go back to, I had to email my mom for a gift card at Walmart. And the

problem with her is there's no way to prove where any of her money is from. Like, who

knows where it came from. I know where my dad's, some of my dad's estate came from,

that she signed over into her name and kept all of it. But the problem with his estate

too is he was working jobs that paid under the table and who knows if he ever paid taxes.

And there's no receipts for anything or no paper trail for anything. And her side was

all from my grandfather using some stock market scheme and working as CEO for a company,

a tool company. And this, for some reason, that money flags every criminal alarm on the

planet. Like every possible alarm you could set off, that money sets off. It's been sitting

out there and no one's explained where it's come from. And then she donates it to me.

And it flags every criminal alarm. And the worst part of it is, I was forced to smoke

cigarettes for 20 years because of this thing. And it's still going. The second I get a gift

card, it starts up that stupid cigarette thing again. Like I have to explain where this money

is from. I have no idea where it's from. I have tried to resolve this and yelled into this camera

like a hundred times explaining this very situation. I don't know what federal agency

or state agency I need to talk to to prove where this money is from because it makes me guilty of

association if I accept a gift card from her. And I'm not trying to be any sort of association.

Involved in any sort of association. I can't get away from the thing. I applied for a job at

Goodwill. They have a supervisor position. I applied there. My face still has a few spots.

They're blowing out over and over again. Probably another one of her scams that is still, you know,

I have to work through to clear because I can tell the second I accept a gift card from her,

those stupid cigarettes start up again. So she's obviously been ripping everyone off,

evading taxes, and doing all sorts of criminal behavior. And I can't step, I can't climb to the

next step to just be employed. You know, I apply for jobs everywhere. I talk to people everywhere.

It's this mile of crime that she committed, my dad committed, my grandfather committed,

that's jamming me from work. And I run out of food. So there has to be a way to resolve this.

You know, a pile of money sitting out there with no explanation. And it's blocking me from work.

You know, I'll just work at Goodwill and not have to worry about it or think about it. But it's

still sitting there. And because it's my mom, apparently it's my problem. I am doing everything

in my power to not have to beg for money and just work somewhere. But with that much crime

in the way, it's blocking me from employment. So anyway, thank you for the donations.

All help is appreciated. I don't know how to get through 50 years a pile of unexplained money

easily. So do I talk to attorneys? I've talked to many police departments.

I've tried every possible avenue on this thing. So I'm going to keep like walking around and

cooling off every time this thing goes off. Anyway, thank you.

Just to explain what I'm going through. So I applied for Goodwill yesterday. I was going to

apply for HEB today as an overnight stalker. And that's just restocking the shelves of groceries

and stuff. And because I'm awake at night, you know, it seemed like a good idea. But I can only

get in, quote unquote, because I'm well endowed, I can only go to certain places in one store.

And that one store isn't hiring overnight stalkers. The other store up the street is,

but I can't go to that one because it's next to a really nice park and all those insane guys that

think you're going to stretch out all the girls are there. So I can't work at that store. I have

to work at the other one that isn't hiring overnight stalkers. This is exactly what I'm

going through when trying to get a job. You know, I have everyone yelling at me to get a job. I'm

trying, but it's impossible when only once I can only get in in one store and they're not hiring

overnight stalkers. So this is what I'm going through every day, having to explain this over

and over again. I, you know, I'll get, I'll end up in some like gang war if I go to the wrong spot.

So I have to be at the right store and the right store isn't hiring the only position that's

available, uh, from where I am. So that's, that's how my employment prospects are going.

Uh, thank you for the donations I've received. I'll just keep uploading videos on here until

some kind of opportunity opens up. You know, I'm going to keep applying online. I'm going to keep

walking in stores, but my options are extremely limited, uh, being well endowed. Thank you.

I sprayed so much of that jock itch spray and ringworm cream and jock itch cream all over the

place that it started up the medical system. Because I've been trying to clear jock itch for

two months and to almost no progress. I don't know if any progress has been made. I've been

taking three showers a day, applying it twice a day or three times a day to no progress whatsoever.

So now I'm concerned it may not be jock itch. That started up the whole medical system.

So I took the bus down to the hospital. The only hospital I could find was this children's hospital

and now the whole thing is jammed at securing payment. I emailed my mom

because it's $2.99 for this thing and I emailed my mom trying to get payment for him because

it could be a more contagious disease than jock itch. There's no way to confirm it's jock itch

because it was just me thinking it's jock itch. So I'm at the hospital now. I sent out two emails.

I'm waiting on those to come back. It's amazing the gears I find myself in just trying to get

through all the crime I'm buried under. This is the latest thing. You know what what I thought

was jock itch? I put enough spray and cream on it to the point where it tripped over the medical

system and now I'm jammed in the hospital with a potentially contagious disease but no way to pay

for the inspection. I'm jammed. It's potentially contagious but I have no way to pay

to get it proven whether it's contagious or not. So I don't know where I'm supposed to be. This is

another one of these things where you know how do you what do you do? I can't do anything so I'm

standing out front of the hospital. We'll see if I get confirmation back to pay to have it actually

inspected and treated by actual medical staff rather than me just buying. I've probably gone

through 10-15 cans of that jock itch spray now and it just kicked right over kicked right over

into the hospital system. So I'm stuck here. It is a very nice hospital at least. Austin has

all the best amenities and the hospital here is gigantic. The only one I could find on the or the

only one I even knew about or saw an opening with was this Children's Hospital one so I walked in

here. But as the saga continues I'm trying to upload every step of this thing to TikTok so

maybe someone can learn from my plight. I'm gonna wait out here another hour or two. Hopefully

your email comes in and then I'll get it actually inspected. Who knows how many gears I'm gonna have

to get through because this probably started when I was a small child. You know my parents

they lived off-grid in a ranch. They avoided everyone so that would also include avoiding

hospitals. So who knows what their medical backlog is and then my medical backlog on top of that.

That all started at once with me spraying jock itch spray. So it started the whole system

and it's gonna be very interesting to see how this plays out. Anyway, thank you.

While going to the hospital, you know I haven't been to the hospital in probably 10-15 years.

I used to work for hospitals too but never got an actual check out or check up or whatever the

word is. But I haven't been to one in a long time and I'm going through this jock itch thing

and I'll have $440 coming in on the 15th but that's all the money I'll get all month

and that doctor visit costs $299 and that's to clear this jock itch which is a biohazard and

could be inhibiting me from work you know because it could be considered contagious

and I can't prove that it is even jock itch it could be something else.

It looks like it could be something else is the problem. So I have to go to the hospital and

get this thing actually inspected and proven what it is and then treated properly.

But that gets me to transportation because I'm having trouble getting to the hospital

getting to and from the hospital with the bus. I had to call in a complaint last night

with the city bus because they changed the night bus routes to this really weird

route. They have the night bus going on this side street with no bus stop indicator

and so I called in and complained and then they called this morning yelling at me for complaining

but you know it's just it's that absurd and I don't think anyone can complain about it

because they just call back and start yelling at you if you try. So that's why the bus route is

so off course. Anyway that's a rant for another day. I was thinking about motorcycles and

transportation and how to get to and from the hospital because I have worked for a lot of

hospitals before. I was just doing IT work but it was a considerable amount of hospitals and

medical facilities and stuff like that. So I know them pretty well and this children's hospital

down the road is a good you know maybe there's an employment option there that would would earn

me a paycheck but getting to the to and from the hospital is now the difficult part

because the only transportation I have is the bus which is right there and

having all these cars here you know using a bicycle or a motorcycle like I might be able to

get in budget for a bicycle but just to be able to get to work on time but having

all these cars right here puts me in so much danger. It starts up the whole hospital organ

donor thing. You know am I making myself an organ donor by using unsafe transportation to get to and

from work? So I'm gonna keep working on the bus to see if I can get it to work for me

and work with me to be employable. I'm probably gonna go back in when when that $440 comes in to

pay for this doctor visit. I emailed my mom saying I have to get a medical evaluation before being

employable and she refused to respond. She is she's a criminal. There's no other way to put it.

She's blocking me from hospital from an evaluation so it's incredibly frustrating.

I will be glad when I never have to email or have anything to do with that woman again

and the sooner I'm employed is the sooner that is. I was also looking at TikTok you know

there's career options on here and I've been doing this content creator thing for so long.

A full-time paycheck out of TikTok would also do the job. So after I get through this hospital

thing I might be able to just get hired at TikTok too. I'll apply down there. Anyway thank you.

So I'm out of money once again.

This time, you know, because I'm a walking biohazard, it's holding me back from work.

And I can't, my mom is completely blocking any hospital visit whatsoever.

I can't even get a basic physical. So that's holding me back.

The last money I got, I spent on that jock itch spray and cream to clear it out.

That's obviously holding me back on top of being well endowed and having my face chewed up and not being able to sleep at night.

So that's everything in the way currently.

I have $2 in my PayPal and that's it. Both my Venmo and Cash App are zero.

And I think my Venmo has 88 cents in it.

So, no, you know, can't really buy anything.

In a few days, I should get my TikTok check in.

But that doesn't do me any good right now.

I have a few corndog bites left over.

And I think I bought a pizza, one of those oven pizzas.

I don't know, deviled eggs.

Some Cheez-Its.

Just mixed crackers.

I think that's what I bought with the last donation.

So thank you very much.

I don't know what, you know, all I can really do is kind of complain on here and tell my story on here and hope for the best.

That's what's been working so far.

So I'm just going to keep at it.

Anyway, thank you.

So I'm still fighting off this jock itch. I'm taking probably five showers a day

using the shampoo or the soap, the jock itch soap, and the antifungal spray, and

the antifungal cream, and the ringworm cream. And I've been doing this for, I

don't know, two months. You know, I probably just ramped up the showers in

the past couple days, but I've been doing at least three showers a day

for the past two months this entire process, and the jock itch ringworm is

still there. So I don't know if it's some backlog or if it's in my

bloodstream or what's causing it, but it is fighting. You know, I'm having to fight

off a much tougher infection than you would have expected. All my time

and energy is going into fighting this thing off. How it started, you know, I said

this before, I dated a Native American woman, and then after dating her, I'm like,

I have this weird itch. I don't know what's going on. So I went to the doctor

and they said it was jock itch and gave me all the treatment for it. This was in

probably 2003, and I tried to treat it then and got it mostly gone, and then it

would show back up and go away and show back up and go away. And now, oh, I think

I got chlamydia from her too. So it's both jock itch and chlamydia from that one.

And the chlamydia, you know, I took the penicillin or whatever and that got rid

of it. And the last time I got STD tested, it came up clear. Although I didn't

test for HIV, I don't think I've ever been exposed to HIV, but you know, now,

I don't know. I wish I tested for HIV. I doubt it. You know, I highly doubt I got

AIDS from anywhere, but because I've had numerous partners, I probably should

have tested for it. Anyway, going back to the jock itch, the only thing I really

think I have is jock itch. And so it had been waving in and out for years and

years. And I think I gave it to a few other girls, which I may, I don't know if

I'm in trouble for that or not. It is just jock itch. I'm 95% sure it's just

jock itch. You know, there's not much else it can be. But because it infects

itself so far in there, it requires so much treatment to get rid of. I always

thought it was considered an STD, but apparently it's not. It's not even

considered an STD. It's just a rash. So, you know, if you get STD tested, jock itch

is not included in being an STD. So that, you know, maybe some of those girls

that picked it up from me, you know, I feel bad about it, but there's nothing I

can do. You know, if the doctors say it's not an STD, it's just a rash, it's not

really, it doesn't hinder performance. So I don't know, maybe I should have done

that better or done that differently. At the time, I was so pinned down that I

couldn't talk very well. You know, I couldn't say everything that was on my

mind at the time. You know, I just have to go along with it. So that might have

spread a little jock itch around, which isn't the end of the world. You know,

that's all it would have been. I never had anything else. The chlamydia was

clear after that one girl. So, you know, I never spread anything else except for

probably jock itch. And it does have some benefits to it. For one thing, it's

entertaining because it gives you something to scratch. And the other is

you have to kind of overcompensate for it. So you have to compensate for having

jock itch, and this makes you work to be more attractive to compensate. So you

automatically become more physically attractive having jock itch because

you're compensating for having this smell and rash that no one can even

see. So I'm gonna keep fighting this thing, you know, with all I got. It's, like

I said, I'm up to five showers a day and still trying to get it out of there. But

I don't know if there's a stronger treatment available. I was unable to go

to the hospital or doctor to treat it. I did get the TikTok money in, but I

thought it was a better idea to just buy a bunch of cans of jock itch spray and

cream and the shampoo or soap and just try to scrub it all out with the

TikTok money. I'm also using that to buy food. I am going live once in a while.

You know, I'm trying to do it more and more, just answering questions on live,

trying to do it in the evenings because that's when I seem to get the most views

on the livestream. So sooner, you know, I'll get it more scheduled down

the road. But now it's like in between like 7 and 10 I try to get a live going.

So, and they're only like half an hour, 45 minutes, but I'm just answering

questions the whole time. So anyway, thank you.

So I was able to get a job interview on the 25th with Goodwill. It's just with the e-commerce

warehouse and that's where the interview is. I don't know what the job is,

but I'm going to show up and see what it's about. Because I've been working on TikTok for so long,

you know, I've gotten used to doing this camera, kind of what I've been thinking about that day

and uploading it to TikTok. So I'm trying to keep this going to the best of my ability

because I have a big old backstory that might be movieable. I don't know if it is movieable.

It's just the Vegas party I got myself into in my 20s that would be the biggest of the movies.

The others, you know, my dad was a bush pilot in Alaska and we would fly hunters out into the brush

to hunt elk and moose and deer and bear maybe. And then we would use a de Havilland beaver to fly

back with the animal's carcass. And I was just a small child for it, but that also might be a movie.

I don't know. You could get one of those The Edge movies, I think. There was one where they

crashed into de Havilland beaver and then had to survive in the forest Arctic to get back to

safety. So you could probably get one of those movies out of it. And also my time in Arizona,

you know, you might be able to get a movie out of Arizona. I went to private boarding school to

ranch and had a few parties out there too. That, you know, is more the high school movie party,

high school party movie, but it still was pretty good. You know,

nothing competes with Vegas though. As far as movies go, the Vegas from when I was 23 to 30

was over the top. The entire thing was absurdly grand. And I've been watching,

I saw clips of that fight they just had in the sphere, and I've never seen the sphere before,

but it looks like an impressive landmark to say the least. And them having fights in there just

added to its appeal. So I was looking on here because, you know, there's so much content on

TikTok that putting some of this content from TikTok on the sphere might make some money.

You know, it might pay, the sphere owners may pay if you can come up with content to put on that

giant screen. So that's another income source that might be available. You wouldn't even need

to be there. You know, you just create content and then try to sell it to them. I have so many

contacts in Las Vegas. I don't know, that thing is probably still running on its own. I haven't

been there in 10 years, but it's probably still running on its own over there. When I was there,

I was installing Wi-Fi networks. So I was setting up wireless networks everywhere. I must have done

a few thousand of them. And then I started working for small and medium businesses,

doing network administrator, and then going out and drinking at night. So that's why my Vegas grid

is probably still running the way it should. And it gives me more access to things like the sphere

if there's an income possibility there. What got me in Vegas is I just started sleeping around

too much and I had to slow it down. So I had to leave to get to stop because it just wasn't going

to stop. There was no way to stop. I had women showing up at my front door. It was getting me

in more and more danger. I had to find a way to put the brakes on all of it. So that's why I left

initially. And if I were to get locked into a marriage, a safe, reliable marriage,

then it wouldn't be an issue where I was because I'd be married. It wouldn't cause this

one woman wants me, then her friend wants me, then their friend's friend.

And it like cascades like that. So if I were locked into a marriage, that wouldn't be a problem.

And as far as this job interview, I'm going to keep applying everywhere

because I'm well endowed. They just opened an adult store right here.

I don't know. I'm really awkward would be the way to put it. I'm well endowed but awkward.

That's why I'm uploading videos on here. So I may be too awkward to work in the adult store.

Although I'm not ruling it out because anything that's a paycheck is a paycheck. So anyway,

thank you.

So as far as my dating history is concerned, it's extensive. You know, this is another thing that's

getting in the way of the hospital and actual treatment. I don't know. I think, you know,

I lost my virginity when I was like 19, I think, to a little blonde cheerleader, and I think I got

HSV1 from her. It's the herpes, just cold sores, nothing downstairs, just the cold sores one.

And I did get tested for it. That was the only thing I caught. And then I dated that Native

American woman and got chlamydia and jock itch. I'm still fighting the jock itch.

And then I moved to Vegas and I picked up a girl that lived next door who looked like Emma Watson,

who was a big deal. I don't know if she still is, but she was back then. So it was a pretty girl.

And then I dated for a long time this woman. She looked like one of those Rammstein goth girls,

you know, black hair, all goth, and dated her for like four years.

But she ended up cheating on me. That was the big Vegas relationship that she ended up cheating on

me. The whole thing was too racist. You know, you pick up a Rammstein girl, you think everything's

going to be like, fine. But no, it turned out to be racist. So I had to give up on it.

Then, you know, I started online dating and just, you know, whoever wanted to go out,

I would go out with. And there were quite a few in there. So I dated like a security officer,

a woman who was a security officer. And I don't know, a surgeon who ended up paying

for the hotel room and everything. We had a great night on the strip. Some of them,

you know, are really fun to remember, but there's just so many that's what's causing the holdup.

I'm trying to bring up more of the memorable ones. Another part Native American woman,

I lived with her for like 10 months, and then got in too many fights with her brother.

And, you know, I got in fights with her too, you know, I've never abused or hit.

I might have, you know, barely yelled. I've probably barely yelled at a woman,

but I've never hit one or, you know, had any sort of domestic

disturbance issue, other than having to break it off with them. Because, you know, one reason or

another. And I don't know, then I dated kind of a chubby redhead woman who, who then her friend

wanted to join in. And so that was my, my only, well, almost my only threesome. There was another

threesome in there. There's a game you can play in Vegas where you just try to pick up the

overweight woman and then try to get with her skinny friend because all of them seem to have

like the skinny hot friend. And so I got pretty close at that with a few of them. But it always

upsets the heavy set woman when you, when you play that game. So I never got that far. They do

always seem to have hot skinny friends. And so after all of that, then there were, there were

probably 20 others in there. I don't even remember. One that was pregnant. This was during my heavy

drinking days. There was one woman I picked up online that was pregnant already. And I don't

know, I think she, she broke up with her, her husband or the father of the child or something.

And then there was another that I went to her wedding. And like two years later, I saw her on

online dating. And she was, she said she was single. So I sent her a message and then got with

her after going to her wedding. And I think that's all the memorable ones in Vegas. And then once I

got out of Vegas, you know, I went up to, I went to Austin first, didn't get anywhere, and then

went up to Boise and, you know, got with a single mother. This was on my first pass of Boise.

Then on the second pass in Boise, I don't know, I got with, okay, another Native American,

a girl that looked like Nicki Minaj. I didn't get all the way with the Nicki Minaj one,

you know, although I kind of wish I had. A Filipino Asian cam girl who was incredibly hot.

And then the last one was this little Selena Gomez lookalike that was Latin America,

Latin American, but from Japan. Like she was born in Japan, but Latin American. And that's when the

whole thing like derailed itself. And I had to like stop completely. But, oh, there were others

in the middle there. When I was up in Alaska, I got with a environmentalist. And then when I was

driving through Canada one time on the way to Alaska, I got with another Native American woman.

So there's probably, there's probably a few others in there I'm forgetting. But, you know,

I tested clean after the last one. So I think I'm clean of any STDs. I didn't get the AIDS test,

you know, and I want to get the AIDS test. I don't think I have AIDS. I've never, I don't think I've

ever been exposed to it. I never, you know, that Latin American woman was, I think she was either

part lesbian or full lesbian. So that started the whole STD fiasco. And that's what I'm still

getting through. And, you know, I would love to get tested for everything, but probably haven't

been exposed. You know, I've always been completely straight. Nothing, nothing with any guys. I don't

want to do anything with any guys. So that's, that's most of my dating history. Although there's

a, there's a lot more in there where I didn't go all the way with them, but I got somewhere with them.

So I, I don't know what weird fetishes I have, if any. The only fetish I've ever really had

is like learning about a person. You know, I'll want to learn about a woman that, you know,

that's a different type that I've never met or been with before. That's why I ended up going

through like all races of women. Because I liked learning about, you know, the heritage and,

and culture's history and, and all of that. So that would be the only quote unquote fetish, but

I, I don't know. I'm going to turn this off because there's cars spinning around behind me.

So anyway, thank you.

So the jock itch war continues. I got much more expensive topical cream from Amazon and

it was like $63 for 2 ounces. And I only made $400 this month. And all that money is going

into jock itch spray, jock itch cream, and ringworm cream. And now this Amazon cream.

So I'm spending very little on food and no clothing or anything whatsoever just fighting

this fungal infection because apparently it can spread. So I have to be careful that it

doesn't like, you know, if I work somewhere it can spread throughout the job or throughout

the workplace. So this is everything I can throw at it. I can't do anything more than

what I'm doing. And it's holding me back from work. I can't go to the hospital. I don't

have money to pay for it. So there's no path for me to take. It's just, you know, maybe

it's misdiagnosed. I don't think it is. I'm going to go in tomorrow. There's a clinic

that gives free STD tests. I'm just going to do another free STD test of everything.

But being in this spot, you know, with no money whatsoever, once again, people say I'm

making excuses. I don't have a way to get through. There's no possible way with an infectious

jock itch ringworm thing to get through if I'm being completely honest. If I'm being

a criminal in some way, then maybe some crime business would hire me. But I'm not. If I'm

being a completely law-abiding citizen, there is no path for me to take to get through to

work a job. So this is what's holding me back. The latest thing that's holding me back is

this. And everyone's going to come on in here and say I'm making excuses when I'm not.

I can't get through. So that's what I'm going through today. I've been fighting this thing

for two months too. I've probably gone through 20 cans of spray, 5 tubes of jock itch cream,

and then another couple tubes of ringworm cream, and it's all still there. It hasn't

done anything. And like I said, I have no way to see a doctor to get an actual prescription

for it, if that will even do anything. So that's where I'm stuck. Anyway, thank you.

I can't go to the hospital for a bunch of reasons. One being, I don't have a way to pay.

So, you know, I can fill out the form and do all the paperwork, but when it comes to the payment,

I have to be able to prove a source of income to pay for the hospital visit, which I don't have.

I don't have confirmation on pay whatsoever. And I don't have any insurance whatsoever,

so I'm stuck without any sort of medical coverage. Also, I'm getting spooked off the

bus for some reason, and the bus was my way to the hospital, which does seem kind of strange,

you know, taking the bus to the hospital, taking the bus to the emergency room.

So I am jammed in some weird gear. And I started going back through my history and how many times

I've had like medical visits and medical evaluations. And an actual, you know, being a

patient in an actual hospital, I don't think I've ever been a patient in an actual hospital.

I've worked for hospitals. I've done their IT work, but never actually been a patient in a hospital.

And I've gone to doctors, although it's been a long time since I was at a doctor.

There is a free STD clinic down the road, but because I'm getting spooked off the bus,

I can't get down there. And the reason I'm getting spooked off the bus

is I was using it to just kind of cruise around to try to find video ideas. And maybe I used the

bus too much. So now trying to get an STD test is getting me spooked off the thing.

Um, it probably is just jock itch. You know, I'm using the much more expensive treatment on it.

Um, but that, you know, now, uh, that went into my food money. So, uh, uh, I'm gonna keep like

trying to find the best path, but this is extremely difficult with no insurance, no

transportation and no income whatsoever. Um, getting a, a real hospital visit is close to

impossible. Uh, it's like how, so I have to self treat myself for everything. Um, the ER, you know,

people were saying, just go to the ER, uh, because it is just a rash that's been there for a long

time. Um, I just never realized how contagious it could be, uh, because it's been there a long

time. It's probably not life threatening in any way. And the ER is for life threatening emergencies.

So all of this would get me in trouble down the road. Uh, I, I don't know what to do.

I'm going to keep trying to treat it myself with over the top, over the counter medications and see

if I can just get at least shrunk way down to earn enough of an income to go to a doctor and then

get an actual, um, get actual treatment for it. So anyway, thank you.

So because I've been sitting in that hotel room, you know,

applying for jobs and, and, uh, trying to earn a living,

that started the whole marriage thing. Like who would I marry?

Uh, why haven't I gotten married and, uh, all of that. So, uh,

starting out, you know, this started when I was a little kid, my, uh,

my parents, like I said, were car dealers. And I don't know,

I think they got married in Reno at one of those little shotgun wedding

marriage chapels. And, uh,

I don't think they ever got family support for the wedding.

So their marriage was kind of between them. You know,

it didn't involve the rest of the family very much.

That's the first issue with me getting married is I don't know if the rest of my

distant cousins and relatives ever encouraged or supported my

parents' marriage. Um, so they are completely distant now,

trying to talk to distant relatives is difficult. Uh,

so for me getting married, you know, that adds to the problems of it. Um,

and secondly, because I was in Vegas and, uh,

in the whole party scene and well-endowed on top of that, uh,

it kind of got in the way, you know, I kept picking up these girls like, uh,

the Rammstein goth girl was probably the closest to,

uh, to marriage I ever got,

but she ended up cheating on me. She was racist. There were a lot of problems.

Plus she, uh, you know, I kind of picked her up at a party one time.

We worked together, but I picked her up at a party one time and it was never the

most serious relationship from the start. You know,

we did end up going out for four years, but, uh, you know,

we didn't know what each other's name was for the first couple of months. Uh,

we were just, uh, sleeping together.

So it wasn't the most serious foundation, uh,

for a, a committed relationship. And you know, at the time I was in my twenties,

so I wasn't thinking about marriage or, or wife and kids or any of that.

So she, uh, you know, she wasn't the best, uh,

white choice in the world. Um, so like I said, I ended up broken up,

breaking up with her and there were a few others,

but they were mostly parties too. You know,

the relationships would last a while and then fall apart for one reason or

another.

I never put much thought into the foundation of them to get them to

last. Now, because I'm older, you know,

I'm thinking more about the foundation and you know, if I were to get married,

how the, how to set the foundation.

So the thing will last for the rest of my life. You know,

that's the point of getting married is to, uh, to, you know,

until death do you part. So, so you want to get married, you know,

and you want to make it last till for the rest of your life.

That's the difficult part. You know,

building the foundation for that thing is difficult because especially from where

I'm from, you know, uh, getting family support,

getting the woman's family support and then getting the thing to stick where you

can spend that much time together, not get mad at each other.

Um, not get tempted by other people and, uh, uh,

be able to be successful while married. Uh, that's, you know, I am,

I'm going to be at the lowest rung of the ladder of that thing trying to figure

it all out. Uh, what, uh,

what makes a successful long lasting marriage? Um,

I'm going to have to ask around because I don't know.

I've never had a very successful relationship. Um, I know,

the one thing I do know is the more work you put into something,

the better it is.

So if I put enough work into the foundation for what would lead to a marriage,

then, uh, you know, just finding a woman that's the right match, uh,

would, uh, become a,

a healthy marriage if the foundation was set correctly. Um,

I never had the foundation set correctly with these others.

I never gave him much thought. You know, it was just, it, it,

it would be like, uh, girl wants me.

And then I wouldn't even think twice about it. Just go for it. Uh,

without any thought of the future commitment or,

or how well we were going to get along with each other. Um,

and if our, if my distant relatives and their family would get along,

so, uh, it's,

it's going to take a lot of work to even get, you know,

started on the bottom rung of a marriage.

But because I'm looking at, at Goodwill for work and other places, uh,

you know, I have a lot of retail experience. So working one of those jobs,

you know, I could get in the mid, mid management, uh, level.

And, you know, it's expected you to be married at that point. Uh,

so now I I'm starting the whole,

I'm starting the marriage thought process to, um, to see,

you know, who would I marry? Uh, how much can I do on my end? So it's,

it's as seamless and comfortable as possible. And, um,

uh, who would get along with, you know,

the other problem I'm having is normally you would ask, you know,

you would ask your wife or significant other,

where do you think I should work? I don't have that luxury.

I have to kind of guess in the dark and Goodwill seems to be, um,

good enough. So that's my one job interview so far.

I'm going to keep putting in applications as they come along and see what other,

uh, opportunities come available. But Goodwill, uh, will hire me.

I'll just end up working at Goodwill. So anyway, thank you.

So, like I said, you know, I'm 42 now. I have a whole slew of ex-girlfriends and, uh,

never been married. And, uh, you know, as far as STDs, uh, I haven't had that many. Chlamydia,

jock itch, uh, ringworm, um, and, uh, got a cold sore. You know, I've probably had like four cold

sores total, uh, and, and just on my lips, nowhere else. So that's the extent of my STD, uh,

experience. And I'm doing my best to avoid them, you know, at all costs. You know, it's,

it, I, uh, I, I have no intention of, of, uh, getting careless now after all of that.

So, uh, uh, trying to avoid STDs is difficult, um, to know like who has something and who doesn't,

because you can't tell. And I've, I've always tested, gotten an STD test after every,

uh, girlfriend, I think almost every girlfriend, may not have been every exact one, but I never

got an HIV AIDS test. And I would have, if I could have, it's just, it's never been an,

it's never been a possibility. So, uh, the next time I get a STD test, I will test for HIV AIDS.

I doubt I got it. You know, I don't think I was exposed in any way. It's possible because I dated

one lesbian. Um, and, uh, it was that whole, you know, you, you date a lesbian, maybe her friend

will join in thing. And, uh, uh, I don't know, uh, where she had been before that. Uh, so that's

what started my hiatus from online dating and dating in general, uh, is, uh, sleeping with her

and then getting an STD test, but it didn't include the HIV AIDS test. So I have to go get an HIV AIDS

test, which, uh, there is a free clinic, but I'm spooked off the bus. I don't have any transportation.

Uh, there's a whole mile of crime in the way of me getting a simple STD test. So that's what I'm

going through today. I walked around Goodwill, you know, I got that interview tomorrow. I, it might be

just a big open interview. I don't know how it works, but I'll walk in there tomorrow. It's like

a half mile, so I have to walk half mile. Um, it's not the end of the world, uh, having to walk everywhere,

but it'd be nice, you know, if some of this crime could be resolved. So I'd have transportation to,

to go to work and, and do the many jobs I'm working now. TikTok is just one of them.

Um, so, uh, that's what I'm going through anyway. Thank you.

So I have an interview in a few hours. It's with goodwill. Once again, you know, I got

woken up in the middle of the night and can't get back to sleep. It's probably around 3 a.m,

but the interview is between 9 and 12, so I just have to be awake during those hours. I don't know

what's waking me up in the middle of the night. It's really irritating. It's been a problem for

years. My face is still a little chewed up, so I don't know if that's going to get in the way or

not. I have been a big fan of goodwill, the whole goodwill corporation for 10-15 years,

however long it's been going on, just because the whole thrift store

kind of scene is fun. You know, it's fun to see what gets donated in there and what treasures

you can find and how inexpensive everything is. So that's why I like goodwill in the first place

and why I applied for a job there. I think it's for a supervisor, although they have me,

I applied for a supervisor position, although I'm interviewing in the e-commerce building,

so I don't know what positions are available or what's going to happen with it. But the other

problem is, you know, I got, I think I got three quarters of the way through this jock itch,

and now working full-time is going to get in the way. And this jock itch has been plaguing

me for 20 years, so I wish I got the whole thing clear before working full-time because it's just

going to start right back up again. I'm like gassing every treatment option possible to get

rid of it, just so it's gone. It's the jock itch and ringworm. And I think, you know, that's all.

I have no way to know because I can't get a medical evaluation, but I think that's everything

that's there. So I'm going to try for this interview, see how it goes, because goodwill

is one of my favorite companies, you know, of all time. It's a place I like to be. I wish,

you know, a year or two ago, they had an electronics department in there that they closed

down. I don't know what happened to it. They had a secondhand electronics department, and that

brought up my whole Circuit City past. I worked for Circuit City doing computer repair and IT

services and stuff like that. That brought that whole thing up, but they closed down the electronics.

So I don't think there's much money in repairing and selling electronics anymore,

but there is still money in cleaning up and selling secondhand items. So that seems to be

turning a profit. Also advertising. You know, all TikTok seemed to boil down to was advertising,

which is kind of what I'm advertising my situation on here currently. So advertising is also making

money. And, you know, just simply putting content on the screen for people to watch makes money.

Having something for people to view and entertain earns a living as well. So I'm looking for things

that guarantee turn a profit down the road and both secondhand items, because there's only so

much new stuff you can buy and throw out before you might as well just pick it up secondhand.

And I was thinking about that with Walmart. I bought a backpack at Walmart for, I don't know,

30 bucks or something three years ago, and it's been used full time for three years,

and it's still going strong. I could donate it and someone else could get another 10 years out of it.

Um, so buying new stuff over and over again, uh, you know, it doesn't really make sense.

There's a lot of room for secondhand items. Also in the fashion industry, you know, you can do

secondhand clothing. The benefit of secondhand clothing is you can modify it however you want,

whatever appearance or look you want to achieve. Um, you just sew it and cut it up and patch it

however you want to, uh, to create that look. Whereas having to buy a high end, um,

shirt clothing, you know, is much more expensive and, uh, uh, may not create or send the same

image you're trying to send. So, uh, that's all the stuff rattling through my head right now.

I'll go to this interview in a few hours. I wish my face was clear and I wish I got that

jock itch completely. Um, we'll see if it turns into the same thing that happened in Vegas,

which I'm not completely against, but I worked for Circuit City in Vegas and then, uh, dated

a coworker and the whole thing turned into these huge house parties at my house. I had a big party

house in Vegas turned into these huge house parties. And, um, the whole thing, you know,

there was never any crime or violence or any real problems other than the whole thing just

kind of fell apart. So that was the only downside to it, but I could almost get those same house

parties going here in Austin. And, uh, they were a ball, you know, they were a ball when it worked

and when it fell apart, you know, you just walk away from the thing. Uh, I don't think there were

any arrests whatsoever. The police were never called. It wasn't that, you know, it wasn't a

big deal. So anyway, thank you.

I was able to get the goodwill job. It's a different job than the supervisor one.

I only applied for the supervisor position because it was the only one available in the

store that's walking distance from the hotel. But I was able to get an e-commerce job.

Apparently they're selling stuff online so you have to take pictures of it then write a

brief bio and post it online. So that's the job I got. It's not far off from what I've done in

the past. Like I said, I've worked in IT and all my Craigslist buy and sell on Craigslist,

which I've done hundreds of times, is very similar. But like I said before, I really like

Goodwill the brand. It's the cheapest way and nothing's getting thrown out with it.

It always pains me. Because I was poor for so long, it always pains me

seeing really good stuff get thrown out. So having that store there kind of

recovering some of that, I like. Part of the reason I went to this hotel

in the first place is because the Goodwill headquarters is right there. It's right next

door. So I can get that Goodwill vibe right there. So I really like the brand. It looks like

it's grown in the past couple years. I was telling them this. There's only so many

times you can manufacture new items that don't need to be thrown out.

That's why buying something new, as it gets more reliable and more dependable, you won't

need to buy new items. It'll all just be bought second hand. So I've always been a big fan of

Goodwill and everything it does. I'm going to keep trying to work on this TikTok. Like I said,

I think next month I'm in queue for $500 paycheck at a just TikTok creator.

And that's not including the lives. So I'm getting some money out of doing this TikTok page.

So now, you know, once Goodwill starts, which isn't until next Wednesday, then I'll be working

two jobs. But this content creator one is fun, to say the least. And I'm trying to log everything

I'm going through so maybe someone can learn from it. The only holdup I still have is this

ringworm is still there. And I need to go get an STD AIDS test, which I haven't been able to do.

So I'm going to try to do that this week. I got more of that topical fungus cream.

And we'll see if it helps keep clearing it. Otherwise, I'll need to go get a prescription.

Um, so that's pretty much all I got standing on the side of the road right now.

The I'm only going to do a pan around because the police are out in full force.

I guess they're doing construction. And it looks like it's just the police cars

parked here without any actual officers. So it's it's just for construction. But you know,

lights that blink, I'm drawn to lights that blink. That's why I was in Vegas for 10 years.

Because Las Vegas is just a lot of blinking lights everywhere. And maybe it's some like,

core, you know, like bought to a flame response. But I always seem drawn to blinking lights.

Anyway, thank you.

I'm trying to get into the work schedule. Because my sleep cycles have been so sporadic,

getting into a conventional, you know, stable sleep schedule is still kind of difficult.

I think I went to sleep at like 8, and then woke up once at maybe 10 or 11,

and then woke back up again at 3, and couldn't get back to sleep at 3. So,

I've been waking up at 3 every morning. This job, the shift starts at 7,

so I might be able to make it work with waking up at 3 a.m. I'm sitting outside right now,

going through the full process. Like I said, I've worked for a lot of retail stores before,

so I'm used to the process. This is because I'm trying to keep TikTok going along with

working this job. I'm trying not to let them conflict with each other,

and so I'm going to keep trying to do these daily or every couple days uploads of

what I've done with the day and what I'm doing. I hope this thing works out.

It's another fun place to be. I really like the store, so I should, relying on my past experience,

should be able to make it work, but we'll see how it goes. Anyway, thank you!

So I don't know if I'm getting like uh involved in a brand conflict because Goodwill is doing this

e-commerce website where they sell a bunch of stuff on online and I'll be doing the listings

for that and I know TikTok shop you know they sell a bunch of stuff on TikTok shop so I'm

hoping there's not a brand conflict there but even if there is you know I'm gonna keep this

going at least until I see a paycheck out of Goodwill because I don't start orientation until

Wednesday and uh you know that gives me some time and I don't know when the first day of the shift

is going to be so uh receiving my first paycheck maybe a ways out and I've been relying on donations

from here and the paychecks from TikTok so I'll keep this going uh you know as long as there's

not too big of a brand conflict I'll keep them both going indefinitely but uh if they do start

to conflict you know Goodwill is a full-time um real job whereas TikTok you know I'm just doing

content creation uh and did I have seen some success and some money out of it but uh it doesn't

have the real structure of a real job plus you know I never went out with any other people from

TikTok uh I never met anyone I guess my face has been chewed up the whole time I've been yelling

uh you know on here periodically and uh begging for for money so probably not the best image but

I never actually met anyone um so uh at least at Goodwill you know my co-workers are right there

you know that's a benefit to uh to Goodwill plus I've always liked the brand you know I went off

on this before I've donated a lot of stuff there um it's walking distance from where I live so I

don't need any form of transportation I can just go over there work full time and not have to think

about anything um and the game plan when I came to Austin like two years ago was when my face cleared

get a job at Goodwill preferably or potentially um you know when my face cleared and it took this

long you know I still have spots on my face uh from where it hasn't quite cleared yet so

that's how long it's taken for my face to clear and uh I'll try to keep uploading videos when I

can I was going to go downtown but because I'm spooked off the bus I'm not going to bother you

and I'll just walk around here uh not much going on um just walking on the sidewalk watching the

cars go by trying to cool off like last night I was able to sleep most of the night pretty

comfortably I think I woke up at three tonight it's impossible um I have absolutely no chance

of getting any sleep um I don't know uh I I think I had three beers maybe four uh trying to be able

to fall asleep at like eight uh seven maybe I don't know somewhere in there so I could do the

the seven to three and then because this this Goodwill shift is uh from 7 a.m to four

so it's going to be up early in the mornings um so uh that uh that's why I'm trying to get

my sleep you know I've been trying to get the sleep cycle set correctly the entire time

and it's still just this this battle of being able to fall asleep so I'm gonna keep working at it

anyway I got a few more donations in thank you very much and uh I'll keep trying to make videos

thank you

So despite not starting orientation yet, I think I'd classify now as working two jobs.

The TikTok content creator being one, and then the Goodwill e-commerce photographer

being another. So once orientation starts, I'll get my first day and we'll see how it

goes. I was a little worried about a brand conflict, but it seems to be okay. They don't

really step on each other's toes that much. So I should be able to keep them both going

simultaneously, which I prefer because the paycheck from Goodwill plus the paycheck

from TikTok content creator should be enough to pay for everything if I keep this going

at current income status, which I don't know. The problem with the content creator thing

is it's kind of a gamble. You know, you don't know which video is going to do well and which

one's not. And the income is really sporadic out of it. But I'm also receiving donations

on here, which I'm very appreciative of. I had, I don't know, 55 bucks in my Venmo account

from donations. And thank you again for the donations. And I went to Walmart and bought

$50 worth of food out of it, which was all the cheap, great valuing, cheapest food I

could buy to live off of. So it should last a week or two. That should be good on food

for a week or two. I have an STD, STI, AIDS test on Monday, which is 20 bucks. So I have

to bust down to it. You know, I'm thinking maybe if I ride the bus midday, it won't be

quite as intimidating. But I'll try to go down there and get this rash ringworm thing

looked at and tested of any possible STDs, STIs. So that's my plan. I don't know. I'm

pretty excited for the Goodwill thing. It's always been, you know, I love thrift shops.

I love secondhand stuff that may or may not work and trying to get it working. That's

always been one of my favorite little hobbies. So them having this whole branch of e-commerce

to, you just put posts online of items that are for sale. And it's all just cool. Like

all the old electronics, they had old Nintendos and all sorts of gaming systems. They went

all the way back to Atari from like 1980. So they had a lot of cool old stuff on there,

which, you know, is entertaining for me. They didn't have much of the new gaming consoles

like Xbox One. There might have been an Xbox One, but then there's a newer one than the

Xbox One, which I haven't even kept up with. I didn't see any on there. I was the original

Xbox generation. So the very first Xbox, I think I was like 19 or 20 when it came out

and it was a big deal. I had a ball with that thing. I had it modded. I had a mod chip on

so you could run on the emulators and had a aftermarket hard drive on it. So you could

just download the games from the CD to the hard drive on the Xbox and then have a list

of all your games on the Xbox, which was awesome. You didn't have to switch CDs. It had a full

media center so you could watch movies on it. This was all in 2000. It was a, you know,

I still haven't quite found an entertainment system that as good as that one was. It's

the best entertainment system I think I've had because you could play all Xbox games,

all emulated games and watch movies all in one system. So it's a shame, you know, because

there's no way to like police the what's pirated and what's not. It's hard to get that design

to work, but I wish they could get it a little smoother. You know, the new ones, you gotta

stream movies and download everything and it's not quite as smooth as that old thing

where everything was saved on the hard drive so you could just click it right over. You

know, you didn't have any weird logins in the way and all sorts of complexity. So it

was my favorite system. Anyway, thank you again for the donations. It's going to food.

I think I got 12 pack of beer this time, which is my first case of beer in a couple weeks.

It's kind of a celebratory case of beer because I did get the goodwill job. It is full time.

I did pass a background investigation and or background check and should be able to

work the job proficiently. So I'm pretty happy with that. Still going through the last of

my face. I ended up walking to the interview with my face all chewed up just because it

was taking too long for my face to clear. I'm like, I'm just going to the interview

anyway. So it's still a little chewed up, but they didn't seem to mind it. I told her

the story behind it and she didn't seem, she, she wasn't that bothered by it. So I got the

job anyway. It should clear up eventually and then I'll have a nice normal face, but

hasn't happened yet. So anyway, thank you again for the donations.

Like I've said before, you know, I still have this rash and little red spots.

Now I can't, I can sort of confirm it's jock itch ringworm, but I can't completely confirm

because I've been to multiple physicians regarding this. You know, I'm digging up

the whole backstory of the thing now. Dated a woman and got a rash and then went to,

uh, I think I went to the STD clinic first, got tested, uh, tested positive for chlamydia,

got the penicillin for chlamydia and then still had this rash and had them inspect the rash.

They determined it was jock itch, fungal infection, well I shouldn't even say,

they determined it was a fungal infection and, uh, uh, gave me some over-the-counter

treatment options. Then I went, you know, I, I tried all the over-the-counter treatment options,

this was 20 years ago, tried all the over-the-counter treatment options, then went to

another physician and, uh, got roughly the same story, gave up at that point and mostly got it

like shrunk down as far as it would go. But I couldn't talk about it for some reason, like I

couldn't tell anyone. Um, so, uh, uh, I, uh, I kind of have, you know, used over-the-counter stuff over the

years and got as small as it would go and, uh, uh, got STD tested I think the whole way through.

I don't know if I ever got the HIV test and I just learned the HIV, there's an HIV rash

that, uh, could look similar but it, you know, there's a lot of differences between this one

and that one. Um, for one reason it's terrifying to look at, whereas the, the ringworm one, you know,

it's, uh, it's pretty tame by comparison. Secondly, you know, I have the odor of jogger, fungal infection

and I have, uh, the, uh, the spots on my legs and, uh, uh, waist area are, uh, look like ringworm.

I mean it just looks like ringworm. It's that circle with a raised, uh, edge around it. So I, I went

through a little bit of an HIV scare last night thinking, not even knowing there was an HIV rash

and, uh, uh, you know, I'm getting scared about that. But I don't think, you know, I'm gonna go

get tested for it but, uh, I don't think it's that rash. I really think it's the fungal one.

Anyway, uh, I'm gonna keep, uh, keep uploading videos on here. I, uh, I have that appointment

tomorrow and I have to take the bus down to it. It's on the other side of the city so it may be,

uh, difficult to get down there. I scheduled it for mid-afternoon and it cost 20 bucks.

I'm gonna have them inspect this rash again. I mean, I've done this so many times. I've probably

been to 10 physicians regarding this stupid rash and had it inspected over and over again and it's

still there. So it hasn't gone anywhere and I've, I've spent the last two or three months putting

over-the-counter treatment on it, following the recommendations and then I went on Amazon and

bought really expensive, all my money, you know, all the donated money and all, uh, all money I

received is just going to this rash. Um, I'm buying basic food items. So anyway, I bought much

more expensive, uh, topical cream off the internet and, uh, it's, the rash is still there. It hasn't

gone anywhere. So I don't know what the issue is. I'm going to have to go complain with the health

department because they almost immediately dismissed this thing, uh, as not being an STD or an

infection of any kind, you know, like it, it's not there. And I had to go in over and over again

and, uh, tell them, you know, this rash is still there. This rash is still there. I've done this

10 times over the past 20 years. So I'm, uh, I'm going to try the, the STD clinic tomorrow,

get tested of everything, and then ask what to do about this rash once again to see if,

if any resolution is found. Anyway, thank you.

So I'm going through absolute terror right now. I'm trying to,

I was trying to get a STD test for all STDs, you know,

anything I could possibly get still going through this jock itch ringworm thing.

And you know, I look at pictures online and it just looks like ringworm.

It looks like ringworm jock itch. There's odor. You know, it's the,

the same old thing. I'm putting treatment all over it. You know,

jock itch spray, jock itch cream. Um,

and then this Amazon cream that's a considerably more potent,

but this is causing absolute terror because I think it was like my shell.

You know, I had this,

this fungal shell that's been holding for 20 years and I'm cleaning it all up is

creating all sorts of paranoia. And, uh, the, the big being, you know,

that I somehow got HIV or, or any of the other, um,

big STDs and you know,

I just tried to push to the STD clinic to get tested and it was terrifying.

You know, uh, I don't know how to describe it. You know, I started thinking, um,

if, uh, if I get an STD test, uh, I'm more, you know,

and come up clear of everything, I'm more likely to get an STD down the road.

Because, uh, you know,

then I think all these women with STDs are going to show up and I'm not going to

be able to resist them. And then I'll catch a bunch of STDs.

So I'm being really cautious. I want to get that STD test,

but it's extremely difficult. Um, I,

I didn't expect that much terror when trying to just push through to get a

simple STD test. I am hired full time at Goodwill.

Orientation starts on Wednesday. Um,

I was trying to get everything cleaned up in the meantime. And, uh, uh,

I was gonna, uh, have this,

this thing clear before going in there. Um, but, uh,

how much terror that was, I may have to wait, you know,

I should because it's a full time job, or at least I think it's a full time job.

Um, I may get medical benefits and then I can use those medical benefits for,

for any health problems that, that may be an issue. Um, I figured, you know,

if I had a big STD, it must flag some kind of alarm. You know, they don't just,

shoo you away. Cause I've been to multiple doctors over this jock itch and I've

shown them the rash and, uh, gotten treatment options.

I've done that 10 times. So suddenly thinking it's AIDS, you know, it's a,

it's really scary. And, uh, because I've,

I've been to so many doctors regarding this very issue. Uh,

they, uh,

they probably would have mentioned if it in any way resembled the HIV rash.

So anyway, that's what I'm going through.

Now I'm at the Moody Center in Austin and,

uh, I was trying to go down to the STD clinic, but it's, uh,

it's too difficult. I think I'm working against the system again.

I have trouble with that. Like all, uh,

all try to, you know,

I'll really want to accomplish something and, uh,

kind of push against the system to accomplish that. Like in this case,

an STD test for everything, because I was, you know, for years,

I was picking up leftover cigarettes on the ground and I was homeless.

So I was going to take, uh,

the first chance I got, I was going to get an STD test. But, um,

the amount of terror I'm going through trying to push into that STD clinic is

impossible. You know,

it's impossible to get over there to just get a simple test done.

So orientation is on Wednesday. You know,

I'll just go work at goodwill and be able to get a test when the option presents

itself. Um, anyway, thank you.

I just received a text message from the hospital that I went to like a week, week and a half ago

saying they had my bill ready for $500. I filled out the forms while I was there and

got to the payment option and was unable to secure payment. I emailed my mom. She refused payment

and so there was no way to pay for the visit. I waited about an hour to see if I could receive

a response. I stopped there. I didn't proceed any further on filling out the forms or documentation

and waited to secure payment before filling out the documentation. Anyway, I never received

a response or never received funds to pay for the hospital visit. At that time,

I asked them how much will this cost because I have to email my mom to secure funding.

They said $299. I said well I'll send her an email and I'll wait for a response. I never

got a response from her and finally left the hospital and went back to the apartment.

Anyway, now a week later I received a bill for $500 so it's not even the same amount of money.

It's now gone up $200 and I never received any medical evaluation whatsoever. It's the same

rash that I've been having trouble with for 20 years. I go through whatever gear or whatever

process I need to to get this thing looked at. Now I was trying to take the bus all the way down to

the STD clinic to get looked at there and now I'm jammed off the bus again so I can't go down there

to get it inspected there. That one was $20 and I had to give up on that. Now I'm stuck back in the

hotel room. The best I can do is just upload everything I'm going through on here so someone

may have the path or answer to take. Anyway, I was able to get a job at Goodwill. I got orientation

on Wednesday. I guess I can do it without any sort of medical evaluation and just go through that way

but this is incredibly frustrating that they would bill me without actually receiving any

medical service whatsoever. I got billed without seeing. I sat in a lobby for an hour waiting for

an email, never received the email, and then left. I never spoke or saw a physician in any way

so I keep getting jammed in these weird mechanisms that I can't get through. I can't get any sort of

medical evaluation on the rash that is ongoing and I was wondering if me using, because I'm using

so much treatment on it, so much jock itch spray and jock itch cream and then that amazon

fungal cream. Because I'm using so much treatment on it, if that somehow tripped their

their mechanism at the hospital and dragged me over there. But I don't know. I don't know if

that's how they make money. They just let rashes continue until you go to the hospital and then

charge you for treating the rash. But I might be able to make, I might be making some

progress on this rash with over-the-counter treatment and maybe you know that just

shuts them out of the loop and they don't get their money. So next thing you know I'm receiving

hospital bills without receiving any treatment. So this is a very interesting problem. I'm going

to keep uploading everything I'm going through on here. This is an incredibly frustrating one

because I did ask them how much would this visit be. They said $299. I said I would secure, you

know, when I can get funding, I'll fill out the documentation. I was unable to get funding,

so I didn't fill out the documentation. Left and they still billed me for $200 more than they said

the bill was going to be. That is an unbelievable con. Unbelievable con. So if I have to take this

thing to court or trial, I will. It's a joke and I can't get medical treatment of any kind.

It's still, I'm still jammed in this system or gear or whatever it is that I can't receive a

simple evaluation on a very small rash that hasn't been looked at in a while. So anyway, thank you.

So, I am supposed to have orientation tomorrow, but I can't get a medical evaluation to see if

this rash is a problem or not. And I've exhausted all avenues. I can't do anything. I emailed my mom

saying, you know, I got this job offer, but I need this rash inspected by a physician

before I can go in there. She responded at first saying congratulations on the job,

but then refused to allow for a simple physical for me to get a rash inspected before I work a

job that involves handling other people's clothing. So, this has to get resolved somehow.

I'm back to yelling on the side of the road because I can't do anything. I can't get through

to a simple employment because I can't get any sort of a physical or medical evaluation done.

And this is, I've been all over the city trying to fix this, and it's impossible. What am I

supposed to do to have a simple rash inspected before working a job that involves handling

other people's clothes? I'm still, you know, I'm doing everything I can to work and not have

to hustle for money. And I'm making a few bucks on here as a content creator, which I just trained

myself completely how to do. But so many people are yelling at me to get a job on here that I'm

just like applying everywhere to get a job. But that's not doing any good because I can't get a

medical evaluation before getting the job. So, that's where I am. You guys need to lighten the

up and I'm getting to a medical evaluation as soon as I can. Anyway, thank you.

I was able to finally get to sleep last night, probably way later than normal, which is strange

because normally, you know, I was falling asleep 7, 8, waking up at 3 or 4. But last night,

you know, of course, when I have to go to orientation in the morning, I can't get to

sleep at all. You know, it completely reversed itself. So I don't know what that's about.

I was able to finally get to sleep, but it's the most absurd situation possible.

So I went, and thank you for the donations, I went and got McDonald's and a big coffee

to be able to stay awake while, you know, I go through this transition that shouldn't even exist

because I've been going to sleep early and waking up early. But the second, you know, I get a job

and have to go to that job, everything jammed up completely and I couldn't fall asleep.

And I don't know if I'm supposed to say I have ringworm, jock itch, rash. I have it really small

and everything's covered. And I talked to people on here and they all said, you know,

they were working various jobs with jock itch, ringworm, yeast infection, whatever,

and just slowly clearing it out. So I don't know, you know, if I abide by this rule of having it

completely clean, then I guess everyone would have to abide by the rule of keeping it completely

clean. And I don't know how many people have jock itch, ringworm, yeast infections. I know

it's quite common. So I'm scrubbing my hands and putting on all the treatments to try to clear it

as quickly as possible. Because I don't have any form of medical coverage currently, can't even

get a physical, I have to, like, do everything myself. And that's making it more difficult

because the amount of questions that pop up are considerable. So hopefully, you know, I'm going

to go to orientation. I don't, I guess I'm not supposed to tell them I have a rash and just go

through the gears of the thing and try to get through that way. Which seems, you know, I don't

know what the best path is because this, it's just a fungal infection that's really small.

I guess it's better to not bring it up, but I don't know. I'm open to answers on here

of how people handle this. I've gotten it as small as it'll go and I'm gonna keep

treating it. And hopefully, I'll get medical coverage so I can actually go see an actual doctor

and get an actual physical done regarding, well, only this rash. I don't think I have any other

medical issues other than this rash and I couldn't get an STD check. And the only

reason I need an STD check is because it's been a few years. I haven't dated anyone or slept

with anyone. The only thing that may set it off is leftover cigarettes, which is all I really did.

So, I guess the more important thing would be to get a physical and make sure I have a clean

medical evaluation. So, anyway, thank you.

While I'm on the whole medical kick because I can't get to a hospital still, you know, it's

I went to orientation. I was there all day. I'm seeing if I get benefits. If I get benefits,

I can go to the hospital with the benefits. This is the absurd situation I'm in.

So that's where I am. I forgot I have these moles on my back that

I don't know if those are bad or not. I can't do anything about them.

There's one on the center that I may not be able to get footage of.

But they've been there my entire life and apparently if they turn purple, that like

turns into skin cancer. I have no way to get them checked either. I'm stuck, completely stuck. I'm

seeing when my first day at Goodwill is, my first actual paycheck day. And going from there,

I don't know if I got paid for orientation. I'm making a few bucks here on TikTok. One of my last

videos did pretty well. So it's going, you know, I know there's ways to advance on TikTok to make

more money. Like, you know, product placement and advertising and stuff like that. I haven't quite

gotten into it yet. I've seen a few emails about it. I'm trying to get there. I was waiting. You

know, my face still has a few of these little bumps on it. I'm just going to keep uploading

whatever I'm thinking or doing that day until all this clears. And you'll have all my back

videos to go through. But my intention is, you know, I'm going to completely clean up from being

on the side of the road and show every single step it took to get from sitting on the side of

the road with a sheet of cardboard to being a productive member of society. And this, you know,

getting through the medical system is the most difficult part. Oh, by the way, without committing

any crime. See, I'm doing all this without any crime being done whatsoever. So that's, you know,

if I just went and got arrested, I would instantly go through the medical system while on my way to

jail. But I don't want to, you know, get arrested for no reason. I've never been arrested before.

So I don't want to start now. You know, I don't commit crime. I don't want to start committing

crime. So I, you know, that's another one of these luxuries that that criminals and prison

inmates seem to get that I don't is, you know, they get medical service when needed and I don't.

So me not breaking the law is denying me medical service, but I'm not going to start breaking the

law now. So I'm just stuck in this position, waiting for the best opportunity to, to push

through. I wish I could get this other, I have another mole on my back. There it is, you know,

it's pretty far away to see, but there's two moles on my back. I don't know if they, if they could

turn purple, you know, if that causes some sort of skin cancer. But they've been there my whole

life, you know, now I'm just going through everything possible that could be a medical

issue. So anyway, thank you.

About to start my second day at Goodwill. And the first day went pretty well. I was a photographer

the whole time, so took pictures of secondhand items coming in, mostly computers, some shoes,

saddles, you know, strange, you know, normal Goodwill stuff. And then the listers post them

online. So once they're posted online, they go to Goodwill Shop or something. I can't remember the

name of the website. But they go on there and then they're set up for auction and sold at auction.

And it seems like a pretty good premise for a profitable business. Because all the items are

donated, there's no overhead. And then you just sell them for whatever and keep the profits now.

The thing about Goodwill is it's a non-profit company. So all the income, like I was

learning about the CEOs and everything, all their income is really low by comparison to other CEOs.

And the employees were complaining about a little bit, but how low their income is for how big the

brand is. It's almost refreshing, you know, coming from such little money for so long.

You know, having that much going back to the community, that much of the income going

back to the community is nice. So I like it for that reason. Just starting my second day,

I didn't sleep at all last night. Zero sleep. Got back from work yesterday at four, I think, and

I tried laying down at like five or six. Couldn't fall asleep. Tried all night,

just couldn't sleep at all. So I am going in on my second day with zero sleep whatsoever.

And we'll just see if I can last through the shift. I don't know. All I had yesterday,

I had a Mountain Dew in the morning. I had Nicorette gum, you know, I was chewing Nicorette

gum throughout the day, a cup of coffee at lunch, and then a Mountain Dew at like three or

3.30. So there shouldn't have been, you know, it didn't seem like there was too much caffeine to

keep me up all night, but I still was stuck up all night. So I don't know what that's about.

I don't know if I'm trying to get in, you know, I have to get in the right zone for a new job.

But the first night, before the first shift and before orientation, I slept pretty well.

But last night, it just didn't happen. So I don't know. I wish I could have slept,

that's for sure. I'm going to try to grind through this thing. It is just taking pictures

and submitting them. So I do get some photography experience. This TikTok channel is going pretty

well. So I'm getting some photography experience from it. You know, that last video did really

well. I'm watching the money come in from it. And the last I saw, I think it was at like,

I don't know, $1,300 or something. Now, I won't see that until next month. So

this 15th, I'm getting $500 in, I think, from TikTok. And then the month after that

will be that big one. So, you know, I'm 45 days away from that money. But it still was really

nice to see that video do really well and kind of pick up all my other videos. So I'm going to

try to balance the two, Goodwill and TikTok. Keep them both going and see where the money

really starts coming in from. I really like the Goodwill structure and how all my co-workers are

right next to me. So, you know, we can all see and talk to each other and know each other.

Whereas TikTok, the problem is everyone's really distant. You know, you don't see or

know anyone. It's just money coming in and uploading videos. So we'll see how it goes.

I'll keep making videos on here and update how my situation is going. Anyway, thank you.

So Goodwill fell apart on me. I don't know if I'd been up for, because I'd been up

for two days, I could not sleep the day before the second shift. And I knew

something was wrong. You know, something had to be wrong. I couldn't sleep the

entire night. Just no sleep whatsoever. So something was just off. And I went in

for the second shift, made it to almost lunch. I'd been awake for 30 hours or so

by that point. And I had to tell them, you know, I had to leave medical reasons due

to exhaustion. I don't know if this is because I wasn't able to get a doctor's

physical or any sort of medical evaluation. It might be likely, but I

can't really do anything. I still can't go get a medical evaluation for anything.

It's been 10 years since I've had one. So I can't get through that way. I'm

gonna start trying other places. I don't know why it didn't work. I might have

been in the reverse the entire time in IT, just in the actual reverse system. So

to go forward, I have to be like a presenter of some kind, which is the

exact opposite of what I was doing before, which was being a technician. So

I'm learning as I go. Because I'm well endowed, the next option was this

adult film store next door. So I'm gonna apply for a job for them. The

problem is they're only hiring full-time. Because TikTok is going so well, thank

you for the donations, by the way. Because TikTok is going so well, I don't want

anything to conflict with TikTok. I still want to be able to make these videos,

tell my story and how things are going, and

be supportive on TikTok. That's where all the support came from.

So I'm gonna try this adult store and just see if it's something to do with

having to work full-time and not part-time, and then have TikTok as the

other part-time. But that's my next step. I have to recharge. I don't know what got

in the way of my sleep that bad. I slept for a few hours. I can't just like sit in

front of the hospital. I've never been arrested before, so I don't want to get

arrested. And I don't have a way to the hospital without it. So I'm just gonna

have to keep telling my plight on here and see how things go. Because that last

video, or a few videos ago, was really successful, it looks like there

might be a thousand or two coming in from it, but I won't see that money until

15th of next month. So I'm gonna be running on donations till then. If I

could turn this into a reliable full-time job, or just reliable enough

income, I would stick to this kind of presentation, telling stories, putting

videos together platform, if that's possible. Now, no opportunities have

presented themselves on here. Oh, the other reason I have to wait on the adult

store, my face is still too chewed up. So I still have too much acting on my

neck and jaw. So once I get those out, then I'll be more employable. So I'm

gonna keep, I'm gonna push for that one next. Because I've been working on this

TikTok so much, I've gotten pretty good at giving presentations. I don't know

about acting or writing. I might be able to learn, but because I have to do the

reverse of everything, meaning inverse IT, so it's all like art and presentation

and content creation, which is the opposite of what I was doing before. So

I'm learning as I go. But I, you know, even at Goodwill, I was really good at

giving a presentation just naturally, without having to try. Whereas before, you

know, I was the worst at presentations. So before TikTok, I was the worst at giving

presentations. After, or mid TikTok, you know, I have no intention of quitting

this thing. Mid TikTok, I'm much better at giving speeches and telling stories and

being a presenter. So we'll see. You know, there may be a job opportunity that

presents itself off of TikTok as well. But as for now, I have to get my sleep

working correctly, and I have to get my face to clear. And I'm gonna go over to

the adult store and see if they have a job and try that one next. And we'll see

how it goes. I'll keep you updated. Thank you.

So I'm still going through STDs and having so many different girlfriends and I got through lucky

because, you know, I'm getting this jock itch ringworm shrunk down. It shrunk down considerably.

Like I said before, I got chlamydia once, I think, and I took whatever antibiotic

and that purged it out. I tested clean for chlamydia the second time. And every time,

you know, I've taken STD tests, I've tested clean except for HSV-1, which is the herpes oral.

And you can look at my lips now. I think I had a cold sore like two years ago.

But if you look at my lips now,

I still have a little bit of those bumps and like weird discoloration. I don't know if there's like

a lotion or cream or something you can put on your lips to make that go away.

Because I'm on TikTok so much and everyone's like a supermodel on here, learning about cosmetics,

you know, I started looking into it. And you can also see in the mirror, you know, I don't know,

there it is. You know, I lost a little hair in the back there. I used to use Rogaine,

but I think I gave up on it. It doesn't look that bad. Plus with my hair short, you know,

it doesn't make much of a difference. But I think that's everything at 42 years of age.

I did have one, I'll show my lips one more time. I had one laser because I had a red spot on my

lip right here. And I went to, I think it was a plastic surgeon. I can't remember. It could

have just been a regular doctor, but they had a laser removal and it's got a little white spot on

it. You can barely see it right there. And it's mostly gone now, but it was a red spot I had

removed. And I don't know if there's another way to do that. Some of the experts on here may know

better than I do. How to just get everything clean and clear. I'm still fighting with my face

a little bit. It's still going. It's these neck spots. You know, I used to play video games

constantly and I would just sit there and I would play video games for a while and just like out of

habit, just pinch these things. And that's why my face got all torn up. But there's still like six

or eight of them sitting there that need to clear out the rest of the way. The other side is the

same thing and I have some discoloration from where the infections were. So I'm just about done.

I don't know if I can tan over that to clear it or if there's some lotion or something to put on it

to get it to just soften a little bit. And I have this scar on the cheek of my face. This was a big

boil while I was homeless. I had a huge boil right here and I was able to get the thing to drain but

it was after scratching, just scratching the thing open, ripping all the infection out. So I was left

with this scar on my cheek and if I zoom in close you might be able to see a little better.

It kind of looks like a battle scar now. So you can see all the dents from where the acne was.

The other side has a little bit, you can see the discoloration. That was all acne and being

on the side of the road without showers caused it all to swell. And I still have some discoloration

there. You know if I tan enough times I think it'll go away completely. But this is what I'm going

through now. Thank you very much for all the donations. That one video did really well on here

but I won't see a paycheck out of it until the 15th of next month. So I won't see the money but

I'm getting through everything. I still have yet to see. I think the course I'm supposed to take

is I go to a doctor, get a conventional physical, show everything wrong, every possible issue,

and then go get an STD test and get tested of everything. I'm 99% sure I'm clear of everything

except for this HSV1 and jock itch ringworm. I don't think there's anything else there. I don't

have any symptoms but I'm gonna go get tested anyway to make sure. I got tested after the last

time I got with a woman so this time I'm just doing it because you know I haven't

had a date in a while so I'll just test for maybe picking up leftover cigarettes.

You know maybe I caught some from it, who knows. So I'll just test anyway. But everything seems

to be running pretty clear. I'm going through what my weight should be. I don't know. I think

I'm sitting at like 190, 200 now but I've been up to 240 pounds and when I was like 18, 19 I was

really skinny and I weighed like 155 pounds. So I sit comfortably around 200 and I used to go to the

gym quite a bit and when I was going to the gym quite a bit that's when I started weighing 230,

240. But you know 190, 200 seems to be my comfort zone. I'm at 6'1", 6'2". I think I'm almost 6'2",

so I can't quite say I'm 6'2". So I'm 6'1 and three quarters but you know having my weight at

190, 200 is a comfortable place to be. You know if I drop too far below it I just feel too skinny

and like I'm starving. So I like staying at 190, 200. Anyway I'll keep uploading videos on here and

updating my process. Thank you.

So I'm going through what my weight should be and I don't know. See, like I said before,

I used to work out at the gym quite often. This was at LVAC in Las Vegas.

That's where most of it was. And then, you know, I had gym memberships, a few others,

I think 24 Hour Fitness, and there was one other. But I used to work out and I weighed a lot more

because I was drinking too much of the muscle milk. And I think my weight went over with that.

But as I sit now, you know, I think I can't weigh myself in any possible way.

But this is where my shape is. Plus, I get to show off my new blue shirt that I got at

Walmart. And it fit perfectly the first try. So it's pretty nice having a new shirt.

Everything's blue in here though, as you can see. You know, blue wall, blue shirt, blue pillowcase.

But I don't know. I think I'm pretty close to where I should be.

I'm probably like five pounds over. I'm getting swept up in

how models look on here and where, you know, where my weight should be. And I'm probably five

pounds over. I have a little bit of a, like, roll on my stomach. And if I worked out enough,

I would be able to get rid of that too. But, and my thighs are a little big. So that's where

I'm sitting from a fitness standpoint, at least with my basic, you know, knowledge of

fitness and what is in good shape and what is not. But the other things I bought with

the donations, I bought the shirt and a bunch of food. So that's where the money is going.

I'm waiting for the next door opening or opportunity to present itself.

I have yet to be able to see a physician for a physical. So I'm still jammed. You know, I went

in the hospital two weeks ago and tried to get, you know, just a basic look at this rash,

a routine check, and it didn't happen. I couldn't secure money to get the rash inspected.

So I had to leave. And then they called a week later and said I owed $500, which I had to contest

the $500 and get it removed, which I think I was successful at. But I still, you know,

I haven't gotten this rash removed. So it went from, you know, trying to get a rash looked at

to having to argue a bill for a service I didn't receive for not receiving any sort of

inspection or treatment for this rash, which is what I was there for in the first place.

So now I have to, I guess there's some other approach I have to make to just be able to go

see a doctor and get a basic physical. So that's where I am with the medical system.

I think I'm healthy, but it's this rash that's still going, and it's been going for months.

I'm using now this top of the line, you know, I said this before, I'm using this

Amazon topical cream on it that really seems to reduce it quite a bit. It's got the little

spots down to little brown spots, and I'll turn on the light so you can see. There's one on my

leg I can actually show. It's just down to that, if it'll focus. And I got it, it looks mostly like

a bruise now, but it's still there, you know, it's still completely visible. So I don't know,

there's two other spots on my legs. One is like behind my knee and then the other is on my thigh.

And I have them reduced, but they're still there. So, and the whole jock itch, you know, that's

everywhere. So it's jock itch and three little spots is all that's there. But I'm using multiple

treatments on, multiple over-the-counter treatments, and it's still just going. And

I'm washing my clothes once a week, and I have enough boxers and pants. You know, my pants,

I think I wear three days each, and then the boxers. I wear two sets of boxers a day, so I'll

wear a set of boxers in the morning and a set of boxers at night to try to get this thing to just

clear out. And the process is ongoing. It's still, as you can see from that clip, it's still

visible. So I don't know, I'll keep working at it. The sooner I can get a

doctor to look at it, the better. So anyway, thank you.

I've been watching clips on TikTok and trying to come up with

ideas. And I've been watching a lot of people, you know, they'll

have like a lot of money and you'll see them like strewn it

out everywhere to show how much money they they have or how much

money they've made. Well, I decided to make my own mini

little version of that, but I don't have very much money. So

it just does that, you know, it doesn't, it doesn't go very far.

I have seen a few bucks in donations coming in steadily. So

thank you very much for the donations. I don't know what

I'm sitting at. I got $102 here and I think another $180. I was

looking at bicycles, but you know, I keep kind of

second-guessing myself. Plus Walmart has bicycles. It'll be

priced. This has happened to me twice now, where a bicycle, one

bicycle was priced at like 90 bucks or something. I got it,

took it all the way up to the front counter. It was $130. So I

took it back. And then there was another bike, a road bike

that was $130 priced. And I went and asked the guy and it was

$250. So everything, you know, none of the price tags are

correct. I don't have enough. I didn't have enough for the 90.

I had $90, but not $130 for the first one. And then the second

one, you know, I'm sitting at like 200 bucks now. And the

thing is like $270. So I don't have enough. It's always like, I

just barely don't have enough. And, you know, what I would use

a bicycle for, because I still use the bus, I would be able to

use a bike to get around downtown and get to and from

the hotel room to Walmart. So that would that would be the two

uses for it. And just to get more footage and content to put

on here because this channel is, you know, it's going pretty well

now. I'm watching the numbers go up. I, I'm trying to do as many

lives as possible. But they are really straining for some

reason, like I have to really motivate myself to do a live.

And the last live I did, I think I had 800-850 people watching.

So it's getting, it's getting up there. That was four times the

amount of viewers I had in the last live I did. The live I did

before last night had 200 and this one had 800 plus. So it was

way up. That one, that one video really boosted my channel. I may

go down to the university again and, and see what other footage

I can dig up or what other stories or whatever rambling I

can do into the camera to see what comes through. So anyway,

thank you again for the donations and I'll keep

uploading.

I was going through the similarities between Nevada and Australia and they're considerable

except for the kangaroos. You know, I don't think there's any kangaroos in Nevada.

But the wide open lake desert, everything seems to be similar except there's no mountains in

Australia. I've always been tempted by the Australian outback and all the wildlife out

there and everything that it involves. You know, it's a completely

different terrain but very similar wide open desert to where I'm from. And it's so lightly

populated. That's the other similarity. You know, way out in the outback there's almost no one out

there. So I think I saw one clip on here where like 5% of the population live in the rest of

Australia and 95% live in in the major cities. So it's incredibly remote. Because I'm from

extremely remote areas, both Nevada and Alaska, it's always been kind of tempting. But it's too

far. It's too difficult. You know, I'm so good at like exploring and sleeping in tents and

now with this videography recording what I'm doing, it's always been kind of tempting to go

camp out there. But I'll probably never pull it up. I shouldn't travel at all anymore. You know,

I've traveled so much up to this point. I've been all over North America, down to Cancun,

up to Prudhoe Bay, North Slope, Alaska, all over Western, well not all over Western Canada. I don't

want to upset border security. Been on the LCAN through Western Canada on my way to Alaska.

And all over, you know, the continental United States, been to Hawaii, all the lower 48 states,

I think I missed like Delaware or something, because they wanted me to pay a toll to go in

there. So I've traveled a lot and it is, you know, it creates instability. But I'm still tempted by

going to these other places like Australia, for instance, and just seeing them and going out in

the Outback and stuff like that. I'm trying to train myself to not want to travel, to be happy

where I am. And that's kind of what I'm going through now, just finding the entertainment in

being where I am rather than having to go somewhere to be entertained. So I was getting

tempted by Australia once again, for like the 50th time, I might add. But I'm gonna have to

continue anchoring myself in Austin. So I stay put. And I'm gonna keep working on this

videography and storytelling, presentations, acting, music, all of that, which is the exact

opposite. Like I said before, it's the exact opposite of what I was doing before. But

because I was just being a technician before and retail sales and stuff like that.

But because I'm getting some success on here, so I might as well stick with it.

Because I am reversing everything I've ever done. I have to relearn everything to do this new

employment. And it's at 42, the learning curve. I still learn pretty well, so I'll learn it all.

But having to completely reverse it, it's keeping me entertained at least. So anyway, thank you.

So I just walked into that adult film store or adult store. I guess it's not even a film store.

I thought it was a film. It's adult store. And because my past is so extensive,

you know, like I said, I partied in Vegas for 10 years and went to Burning Man, went to EDC,

went on online dating too much, and was just picking up women all over the state.

So because of that past, you know, I'm finding myself bound to certain areas.

And also being well endowed, you know, I'm also bound to certain areas. That's also

shrinking my scope or area or places I can be. I was also eyeing the nightclubs, you know,

maybe I can get my foot in the door there. But this, you know, this adult stores right here,

I was going to film a clip in there, but I don't think there's any section of the

store I can film a clip. It's just too much. It all was. So I was going to try to give them

some advertising that way because they just opened the thing a week ago. And, you know,

every time there's like the two people working there and that's it. There's no one else in the

store. So if it were up to me, which it's not, but if it were up to me, I would have had some

sort of grand opening party thing with lights and music and all sorts of stuff like that to draw

people in. That's how the grand openings were in Vegas for everything. So, you know, that's how I

started this one. But again, you know, it's not it's not my my deal. So they they probably do

things softer or lighter in Austin than Las Vegas. But anyway, I'm still fighting off this rash, too,

which, you know, everything I can research about it, I still haven't been able to see a doctor.

But anything I can research about it, it's just jock itch, fungal infection, ringworm.

And, you know, I'm doing three showers a day, doing everything the proper treatment,

and it's still it just keeps going and going. So I'm fighting this thing off like you wouldn't

believe. I don't think I have any other physical or physical, mental or

or health related ailments of any kind. It's just this fungal infection. So I'm going to keep

fighting it off and asking for answers on here to see if anyone has a good solution.

But I'm kind of stuck, you know, while this rash continues, you know, I feel bad about going

anywhere, but I can't get the thing to clear. So I'm stuck in the middle, like don't know what to

do. It would be really nice if I could get rid of it once and for all.

And the sooner that happens, the better. Anyway, thank you.

So I'm getting a few bucks in donations in and while going around you know thinking I'm

I'm just getting my standard food with it so far but while going around you know looking at stuff

to buy those bicycles are tempting but I'm gonna end up putting the money into a doctor's physical

and SCD test medical evaluation and rash fungal infection treatments. So that's where it's gonna

go. I haven't been able to schedule a doctor's appointment yet but I'm just gonna do the routine

doctor's physical and see what what he or she says about having a few spots in my leg. I have

them down considerably just using that Amazon cream. I can't remember the name of it. It starts

with an E and ends in a max. Anyway it's something like that but I've been using it quite a bit and it

has reduced the rash considerably. So potentially given enough time it could get rid of it completely

but as I was saying in the comments I've been at it full full three months of treatment so far

and there's still spots on my legs and various you know itches. So I'm pretty sure the thing

is still there. Hence going to a doctor's physical and seeing if I can get the stronger prescription

medication for it just to eradicate this thing completely because it needs to go.

You know like I said I got 20 years ago I would kind of half clear it and give up and then half

clear it give up. So now you know I'm I'm committed to completely eradicating this rash so it's just

gone entirely. That's been the the big medical concern I've had is just this rash. I'm still

vaping a little. I'm chewing the nicotine gum and I'm having a few beers in the evening.

That's about where I am. My teeth I have two notches in the in the front of my teeth and that's

all my teeth are original. The only cavities I think are those two front notches and they're

from having braces and they kind of when I was a kid I had braces and the glue from the braces

kind of ate away at my teeth a little bit. So they were really small then they've kind of dug

in deeper now. I've been trying this toothpaste that's that's dedicated to repairing enamel

so we'll see how much that helps. I know the beer is chewing into my teeth a little bit.

I'm not eating any not much sugar I'll put it that way. Gave up on Mountain Dew entirely. I'm

just having sweet tea and Crystal Light. So that's what's getting my beverage fix

quenched is just having those pitchers of Crystal Light sitting there and I just drink it.

But the sweet tea is really good and it's sugar free so I don't have to worry about sugar.

But like I'm having a few cookies here and there so that's that's like my entire sugar intake.

The beer is what's really chewing up my poor teeth like I can feel it I can feel my teeth get

sore after two beers or so. So I'm gonna you know maybe I can see a dentist I don't know.

I'm only getting you know I only got so much money in so a doctor's physical and a dentist

would just about deplete all of it. But that's really where it should go so that's that's

probably gonna be my main investment with this this batch of donations. Which once again thank

you very much for. I'm gonna keep uploading content to this channel and going through my

life story and progress I've made and what my goals are and all that stuff. So anyway thank you.

So I was going to go downtown to 6th Street and maybe the clubs tonight to have a beer or two

at one of the bars, but I gave up. I can't tackle that bus. If I had transportation to go down there,

I would have gone down there, but I'm not up for the bus. It throws me in this weird track where

I'm on a completely different track from everyone else, so it doesn't really work for the purpose

I need it to. So I'm just, because I'm still fighting off this fungal infection, you know,

I'm going to keep fighting the battle at the hotel and just stay in. But I would have gone down and

gotten a clip of downtown tonight. I'm trying, you know, I just spent $100 at Walmart, which is the

most I've ever spent since I got here, from the donations. So thank you again for the donations.

And I bought, you know, a pair of jeans, another shirt, so now I have three shirts total.

And like wart remover and that fungal shampoo and I don't know what else.

Cold sore treatment, although I don't have a cold sore, I just got the treatment and throw it all,

throw it on to see if there's any of these little bumps on my lip that'll remove. I don't know,

they're probably acne anyway, but I'm just throwing medical everything at everything I got.

I got a new scrubber, Neutrogena, I don't know, a bunch of food. So that's my plans for the night,

is just cosmetic everything. The benefit of TikTok is it is so much cosmetics, like the entire thing

is cosmetics. So, you know, you start catching yourself, like, you know, what shirt will look

good with what pants, which is something I've never thought about before, other than

trying not to dress all in black, which I had a tendency to do in Vegas over and over again.

So, you know, and all this cosmetics like wart remover and face wash and,

I don't know, shaving gel, you know, stuff like that, that I've taken way farther than

I've ever taken before. But if it gets rid of this ringworm fungal infection, then it's worth

its weight in gold. You know, I don't want to say quite gold, maybe gold's a little more valuable,

but it's worth a lot having this much going into cosmetics. And having my face chewed up for this

long, you know, as part of it, as I've said before, that was the motivation for starting TikTok in the

first place was my face was all chewed up and I was sitting on the side of the road. So I didn't

really care what I looked like. And everyone on TikTok was obsessed with how they looked.

So I thought it would be a funny reversal to have my face all chewed up on TikTok and then get my

face clear, get all my problems clear while intentionally looking bad. Well, not completely

intentionally looking bad, but trying to make it as sensationalized as possible to create

shock value. So I think that's what the initial motive of TikTok was. But it has been

an absolute godsend from the start. You know, it was fun. Before I uploaded my first video on here,

um, I was watching TikTok videos on open Wi-Fi all over the place on that tablet.

And I haven't, you know, it'd be the middle of the night and I'd be sitting in front of,

I don't know, Dunkin Donuts and have the police show up and make me vacate over and over again.

While I was sitting on the Wi-Fi, I was probably doing that for like six months before uploading

my first video, completely homeless, you know, living in a tent in the jungle in Florida,

just outside of Kennedy Space Center. So it was a Titusville, I think, and getting told to vacate

from everywhere. But, uh, uh, going through that Lieutenant Dan, um, how he went through a

hurricane in, um, in that boat. I don't think I ever went through a hurricane out there,

but somewhere really close, like winds strong enough to push my tent completely on its side.

So the tent was completely flat and, uh, trees were falling over all over the place.

It was really windy to be in a tent. So I went through a bunch of tropical storms,

very close to hurricane level and, uh, uh, braved all those while I was there.

So I was pretty impressed with him, you know, him rocking around in that boat in a hurricane.

I don't know, I probably would have, would have found another spot to be. So, uh, he one-upped

me, you know, I would have had a tough time in that boat with it rocking around in the waves

like it was, uh, during the hurricane. So, um, I was also staying away from the coast because

the hurricanes would always hit the coast much stronger than more inland. So the, the inland

spots that were in like the dense forest, um, were, uh, uh, safer just because, you know, the

winds would, would slow down. Whereas right on the coast, you're, you're hitting max wind speed

of that storm. So, uh, that, that kind of slowed my, uh, storms down a little bit too, but they

were a thrill to be out there in the tents when, when everything's blowing around and it's pouring

rain and there's, there's lightning everywhere, you know, it was, uh, it was an, an, uh, event to

say the least. So anyway, I'm happy to be in Austin. You know, I would have gone down, down

to the bars tonight and made a video, but I just don't have good enough transportation to get down

there. So, uh, I'll be staying in tonight. Anyway, thank you.

So I've been going through, like, trying to figure out who I should respond to and who I shouldn't.

As it sits now, I'm just answering all comments I can get to and all requests I can get to,

all the DMs I can get to. So I'm just trying to answer as many people as possible. I don't know

if I'm in some different category now, because there's, I'm up to 80,000 followers or something,

which is amazing. You know, I'm just, this thing started out, uh, me just uploading videos on the,

uh, the side of the road to say my, uh, show my situation. And, uh, it kind of just kept going

and going. And, and I had a few viral videos, like a year ago, I had a really big one and then, uh,

or maybe a little over a year ago and then a week or two ago, I had another good one. So,

and there were a few in between that kind of steadily brought up my, my follower count, but,

um, now I'm getting so many comments and so many requests that I'm trying to answer

as many as possible, but, uh, I'm gonna, you know, you're gonna have to be, uh, be patient for some

of them because, uh, it's, uh, there's a lot coming in and I'm welcoming as many comments,

questions, um, uh, DMs as, as people want to send. Um, I will, uh, I will try to respond to any

questions on there as, uh, as quickly as possible. But, uh, as far as now, I don't know which,

which bracket I fall into. Um, so I'm just going to keep responding to everyone and being social

with everyone and, and see where I end up because I don't have any transportation. And, uh, I think

I'm sitting at like $500, $600. So the most I've had in, in a year, um, from donations. Uh, so

thank you very much for the donations, but yeah, I'm sitting around that much money. So it's enough

to go buy food and clothes and stuff like that, but not enough for transportation. You know,

maybe I can get a beer at a bar or somewhere or something, but, uh, that's about all I, I, uh,

can really get out of it. So I'm, I'm still stuck at this one spot, um, which isn't the end

of the world. It's a comfortable room. You know, I'm just working on, uh, getting, uh, uh, my physique

and face and, and all rashes clear, uh, as quickly as possible, just so I'm a clean, healthy person.

Um, but my face still has a few nicks on it. So I'm waiting on those. And, uh, I, you know,

I still have a few ringworm jock itch spots, so I'm getting rid of those. Uh, that's what I'm

doing now. Anyway, all questions, comments, direct messages are welcome. Thank you.

I just bought a new dust light for this setup and so it clips my phone and I have a full ring light

around the phone and it's to help maybe do more lives although I'm still working at getting the

lives working. The last one I only lasted 20 minutes at so I'm still working at getting

more time on the lives. You know it's just work to get that thing working and then answering all

the questions and you know it just gets it feels bombarded almost so I'm going to keep working at

until I can do the the lives better. But I got this light you know to to help with my face and

to kind of get me in the right mode to be able to do lives to to earn more from them.

Once again I have to say thank you for all the donations I received. I showed this in the live

but I was able to go to Walmart and do the cash at cash back thing and so I now sit at

$500 in cash which is the most I've seen in a long time. I haven't seen $500 in cash in

I don't know seven years so I'm pretty happy with that. Thank you very much for the donations.

I'm going to keep working. I'm working on my face that's part of this light thing to get my face

clearer. I'm using Neutrogena twice a day but that's really the only thing I'm using on it.

I'm also working on my weight. I don't know what my weight should be. I used to go to the gym

quite a bit and I don't know if it's a good idea to get a bunch of exercise and get in really

good shape but change your diet so much that it doesn't do you any good because then the second

you stop working out you get really fat because your diet has changed to this lots of calories

system. I'm trying to get my diet set where it should be. I'm eating a lot of vegetables.

The only really bad things I'm eating are pizza and cheeseburgers. I don't even know if they count

as bad. I'm trying to get more into pasta and salads and stuff like that just so my weight

stays where it should be. I have been overweight before. I think I was up to 240 pounds.

That's when I was going to the gym a lot and we were just having a weight competition with each

other who could weigh more. I was up to 240 and then I had a big old gut and it was just

it wasn't the right way. This was when I lived in Vegas. Now I'm trying to get my

diet set correctly so that I'm eating the right food before getting any exercise whatsoever

so that I stay in shape without having to exercise excessively.

Thank you. Thank you again. I'm going to keep working on this this channel and program and

try to get more comments answered. I'm trying to use the laptop to answer comments but it

it's more difficult than the phone because of the interface. It's easier to type out messages

back but the interface on the website isn't as good as the interface on the phone. So it's a

shame because I would be able to answer a lot more comments on the laptop. I'll keep answering

on my phone to as many as I can get to and I'll try to answer all message requests as well as

they come in. So anyway, thank you.

So I've been working on building trust with people to the best of my ability.

Because, you know, this was years ago now.

But before that, you know, I was homeless for a good two or three years. I lived in a van for a

year of it. And so rebuilding all the trust is what I'm going through. You know, just trust

with the community, trust with everyone. I've never been arrested or brought up on any sort

of criminal charges. The only thing that would probably even ping the radar is one time I forgot

to pay a speeding ticket. And it wasn't even that I forgot, you know, I got the speeding ticket

and like three weeks later, they suspended my license. And so I paid it promptly. But I didn't

know the grace period was three weeks. You know, it was a very short amount of time to pay the

speeding ticket. So I paid it the second they notified me and then I had my license reinstated,

I think. I can't remember. There might have been a period. But it was a really like bad situation

because I think I got cited for doing a 45 and a 35. I don't even think I was going 45. I think

I was going under that. But they cited me for it. And then I moved down to Reno. And

like a few weeks later, I think I got a phone call saying that my license had been suspended

from an unpaid speeding ticket. And the whole thing sounded like a scam. You know, it sounded

like someone was trying to con me because you can't suspend a license after three weeks of

not paying a speeding ticket. So I contested it a little bit, but then ended up paying, you know,

I paid the whole thing, but got my license suspended kind of unjustly, if you ask me.

But that would be the only thing that would ping on on my background. So other than that,

you know, and I wasn't arrested or anything. So I've never been arrested, never had any

serious charges. You know, I never even went to trial for that thing or anything. It was

it was 45 and a 35. I wasn't even going 45. And they were completely jumping the gun on on

suspending licenses when, you know, a three week grace period is pretty short for paying a

speeding ticket. So anyway, that that's that's a whole nother story. I won't get into it now.

I was living in a trailer then and I was down. I moved from I think I was in northern Idaho

and I moved down to Reno and the speeding ticket was in Coeur d'Alene, Idaho. So I gave up on that.

You know, like I said, my parents met in Lake Tahoe. So Coeur d'Alene and Lake Tahoe are kind

of similar to each other. So, you know, when I was when I was living in a trailer, you know,

I could go anywhere. So I was I was having fun going different places and meeting people and

stuff like that. But anyway, going back to building trust, you know, it's pretty difficult

from this position to, like, figure out who to talk to and who who I should be associated with

because association, you know, that's another one I have to be really careful about.

I shouldn't associate with anyone with a criminal past because I don't have one.

So, you know, I have to be careful and I just have to kind of climb to the best of my ability

to get to the social network I should be in or social system I should be in

to to actually have a successful

life in the community. Because on top of all of this, you know, I was born

in the middle of nowhere, Nevada. You know, I was born, you know, I was physically birthed

in the Winnemucca Hospital, but we had a ranch way out in the middle of nowhere.

And so that's where at least the first four years of my life were spent were spent there and in

Alaska, in Tulsona, Alaska, which is another extremely remote, far out place. So that puts

me really way down on the totem pole when people ask where I'm from, because both Tulsona and

Winnemucca aren't the nicest parts of the country. So trying to climb up even in Austin, you know,

Austin is like this futuristic, awesome city in comparison from where I spent my childhood,

just because it's so big and so developed and so educated that, you know, climbing into the

social circle of even Austin, that seems to like me for being from Winnemucca and being from Alaska.

Even climbing into the social circle in Austin is a climb. So once I get my face clear, I'm going

to be a little more social. Right now, you know, I'm just waiting for this face to clear out

completely. I'm doing everything in my power to get it completely clear of any acne, and then I'll

be a little more social and try to go out a little more and have a few beers with people, potentially

do interviews and cameos. I haven't quite gone through everything yet to figure out what I'm

going to do, because of course I'm trying to earn a living. And TikTok was what picked me up off the

side of the road. You know, I just upload a video on TikTok, it picked me up off the side of the road,

and so it's my major investment in time. So I'm going to keep trying to make everything

revolve around TikTok and hope for the best. Anyway, thank you.

So I've been working all day at cleaning up my appearance, mostly the jock itch,

fungal infection, getting all the moles removed, getting this acne taken care of,

and looking at different cameras that can take clearer video. Because this one,

you know, I'm having a tough time with the focus. I kind of have to do it blind. I'm using the rear

camera because it's sharper than the front facing camera. So I'm using the rear camera,

but the focus is like, you don't know what it's going to focus on. So it's a Motorola stylus.

And if, you know, I have to manually lock the focus, because if I don't, it starts like focusing

in and out and creates all this like focusing issues. So I'm manually locking the focus.

And when I lock it, you know, sometimes it focuses on my face. Sometimes it focuses on

the background. There's no way to really know what it's going to do. But I'm out walking around.

I'm looking at the other hotels nearby to see if there's any cheaper monthly rates

to see if I can save a few bucks. I'm up in, I think it's called North Austin.

I don't know if it's probably just Austin, but it's a pleasant enough spot to be.

Because I don't have transportation, you know, I'm stuck in this one spot. So

I'm kind of out browsing around looking for video content, looking for what the best hotels are

to stay at and trying to clean up my appearance as much as possible and get as good as possible

at giving these little video presentations and potentially, you know, down the road doing

interviews and cameos and all sorts of stuff. I'm still, you know, I've said it a hundred times, but

you know, I am well endowed. So I don't know if I'm going to open the door on the adult

industry or not. If I can make enough money doing these presentations, stick with it.

But if not, you know, wherever the money is, is where I'll be. So that's also what I'm kind of

mulling through right now. I slept for most of the day, so I'll be up tonight like usual.

And I'll just be trying to come up with videos and stuff to talk about. So anyway, thank you.

So I'm sitting at the bus stop and I can't, you know,

I just can't quite get on the bus. So I'm stuck without it.

It was my only form of transportation and I don't know what happened. You know,

I called in a complaint and, uh, uh,

because it wasn't on schedule or wasn't on route,

I think it was on a different route. They had a bus stop, uh, posted and,

uh, uh, on the, uh, on the app, there was a bus stop posted,

but when you went to the physical location, uh,

there was no bus stop there and the bus blew right by it.

So I ended up missing it and it was, this was in the middle of the night.

So I called in a complaint for that.

They called me promptly in the morning and I went through a huge, uh,

mess of drama with it. But, uh, ever since, you know,

now I'm just like spooked off the bus, you know, I'm done with it.

So I'm stuck in this one spot. I was going to record more of it,

but, uh, uh, there's so many people milling around.

I don't want to record anyone without their authorization. Um, so it's, uh,

this is the footage, uh, I'm able to capture. Uh,

it's my only form of transportation.

I was looking at bicycles and other ways to get around, but, uh, uh,

it's, uh, you know, I can't get very far on a bicycle and I was going to go like

downtown or, or something to get footage because it is Friday night.

And, uh, everyone's probably down there, but I don't have enough to go.

I'm stuck here. There are a few bars within walking distance.

I was going to go down to and just try to socialize with people, uh,

in the area, um, to see, uh, see what I could,

what I could, uh, accomplish or what friends I can make and all that stuff.

I may walk down to those bars and get a clip of them. Anyway. Thank you.

So I've been trying to do more and more lives. Um, and as I was saying on live,

I'm trying not to get these to conflict with each other.

So I'm doing like a main video and then a live, but you know,

I'm telling the same stories on both. So now I'm,

I'm going to rehash what I said on live about having no transportation and,

uh, uh,

being stuck in the hotel room cause I can't seem to get on the bus. So I do,

you know, like I said,

I lived in Vegas for a long time and would go out drinking at the bars.

The problem with Vegas is it got too much, you know, it was just too much,

uh, nightlife party. You know,

Austin is a much more throttled back, uh,

town. So I like it a lot more for that reason when it still has plenty of bars

and, and nightlife, um, available.

So I really like it for that reason. But because, you know,

I'm bound to this hotel room with no transportation, I can't really go anywhere.

So what has been working up to this point is I'm just saying whatever's wrong

into the camera and it's somehow like gets fixed. Uh, uh,

the it's worked, you know, I, I've been working on my face from day one with it,

which is almost clear. You know, I still have a few, uh,

spots remaining. So once those are clear completely, I'll be a little more, uh,

uh, enthusiastic about going out. But as it sits now, you know,

with no transportation,

if someone were to give me a ride down to a bar or a nightclub or place to do an

interview, you know, that they're paying for whatever, um,

I'd be, uh, I'd be available for that. Um,

because I have so much experience in bars and nightclubs, uh,

that may carry over pretty well in Austin. Um, and you know,

like I've said a hundred times, uh, being well endowed, I have to be very careful,

uh, which, um, circles I try to get myself into because,

uh, it can cause a lot of drama if I go the wrong way.

So I have to be careful and that's why I just keep saying well endowed on here

over and over again until I'm in the right, you know,

until everyone knows everything about me. So I can't, uh,

possibly upsetting one. Um, but, uh,

uh, I do like to go out to bars and nightclubs. Um, if, uh,

if I could find safe transportation,

this is the other thing I was explaining on live, um, safe, you know,

trying to get in the right circle of people.

I don't have any sort of a criminal history and I want to keep it that way.

So I'm avoiding all association. Uh, I don't want to, uh,

uh, be involved with any, any sort of criminal activity. Um,

so I, I want to stay completely clean and I want the people I'm friends with to

be, um, clear of any crime whatsoever. Um,

the past is the past, but, uh, you know, currently,

you know, not criminal, not trying to be criminal, uh,

is where I want to be. Um,

and because I'm filming everything on tick tock,

uh, there's no way for me to keep any secrets. Uh, I,

I would come across as a snitch or a rat or, or whatever. Um,

just because, you know, if you tell me something,

I'm going to know it and I'm going to talk about it.

I'm completely unfiltered with talking. So, uh, uh,

I don't have any secrets on anyone currently and I want to keep it that way.

I just don't want to know it in the first place.

I don't quite classify as a snitch for that reason because I encourage people if

they have some secret, I don't want to know it. Um, uh, they can,

they can do the same thing I'm doing and just tell their life story on the,

on, on the phone and see who can help them out there.

But, uh, I'm trying to stay, uh, clean of, of any criminal,

uh, activity whatsoever, which is why I, I really like the police.

Uh, I'm, I'm a big supporter of the police, um, uh,

and what they do. Uh, then they were saying, you know,

that maybe I could be a cop. Well,

I don't think I can be a cop because being well-endowed would wreck havoc on a

police department, uh, anywhere. You know, it's, it would, I,

I don't think it could actually even physically work.

So I have to stick to the nightclubs, bars, um, adult entertainment.

I haven't even started on the adult entertainment thing. Uh, I'm just,

I'm just doing bars and nightclubs to see who I can become friends with and

where money might come in from. Um, I've done, you know,

I've done very little adult entertainment in the past, never made any money,

uh, had a few successful videos. Um,

but that was it. And I never got paid for them. So, uh,

now I'm setting it really strict where I have to get a good paycheck before I

go, you know, before I, I go into anything. Um,

so tick tock up to this point has been a good, uh,

uh, form of income. Um, at least this last month,

uh, you know, I know I've, I've hustled on here quite a few times,

but it has worked. Um,

one of the premises for this channel in the first place was having a,

a piece of digital cardboard where, you know,

rather than holding up a sheet of cardboard,

you just tell your story into the phone and then let people online decide,

uh, uh, if you're worth, uh,

donating to or not, which, uh, that was one of the premises for this thing.

The other thing was just, uh, saying whatever unfiltered into the camera.

And, uh, uh,

sending it out there and just letting it do whatever it does online go viral or

not. Let everyone talk about it all they want, share it around all they want.

Uh, which has been pretty interesting, um,

how this page has gone when it's just, you know,

boils down to me just rambling into the camera. So anyway, uh,

thank you again for all the donations and gifts.

I'm trying to go live as much as possible. Um, but you know,

I'm also looking for good footage. So, uh, any,

any good footage that may be able to go on this channel, I'm interested in,

send me a DM anyway. Thank you.

So I'm out walking around yet again and, uh, couldn't sleep.

You know, I slept most of the day, sort of, you know,

it's kind of my sporadic sleep schedule, but I slept most of the day, sort of.

And then, uh, you know, still restless,

wide awake at night. And I was going through everything, you know,

I did yesterday. Um, just thinking about, and, and what I've done,

I need to take a step back from the road. Anyway, uh, what I've done.

What I've been through. And, uh, I, uh,

I did two lives yesterday and apparently I got a DM that I used a word that has

now been classified as racist in one of the lives.

And I didn't know it was a racist word.

Apparently a month ago it changed to being racist. It's a, uh,

it's a word used to describe low, uh,

low income housing communities. Uh,

that, uh, uh,

I always like to reference them as having a lot of trash blown around, you know,

that's how I, I see them. Uh,

but, uh, apparently that word is, uh,

uh, now considered racist, which no one told me that.

Uh, I did not receive the memo.

I have to learn this whole new system because that has been a very common word,

um, throughout my entire history and, you know,

through everything I've known, um,

never seeing it as racist in any way, uh, at all.

You know, it, it's almost, uh, irritating that it changed,

uh, because I referenced myself as being from a low income,

um, uh,

not more rural area, but still a very low income area.

So, uh, uh, I, uh,

I got lights moving around behind me. Anyway, I, uh, I do apologize.

You know,

I'm going to have to learn this whole thing about giving public speeches and

public presentations, uh, to make sure I don't step on any toes.

They did let me know that this just changed like a month ago or something.

And so there was no way to like, get a, get a briefing or memo on it.

And I don't know if it's going to stick or not. Yeah.

I'm basing this off of a DM I receives. Uh,

so I didn't even look up if it's true or not. It probably is.

So now I'm going to go through everything I'm saying,

make sure I don't say anything offensive or too offensive to anyone. Um,

I'm doing my best to get through this reversal because I'm going

through, uh, from being a technician,

which fell apart on me because I'm well endowed. And, uh,

apparently that caused the whole thing to fall apart. Um,

so I'm switching from being on the technician side of things to being in front

of the camera. Uh, so I have to learn, you know,

like what I can and can't say and, and, uh, what I can,

uh, what I can do. So I'm going through that.

You know, if you see anything that I say that seems dumb, uh,

just send me a DM or post it in the comments. Uh,

there's going to be a lot of stuff I'm getting wrong on here. Once again,

the premise for this whole channel was just yelling into the cell phone and

seeing what happens. So I'm going through the whole cycle of the thing.

Um, but I, I don't mean to offend anyone too much. Uh,

so I'm, uh, I'm going to keep, uh, uh,

working at it and, uh, uh, make sure I don't say anything that's,

that's wrong. I am very supportive of all types of people. I live, you know,

all my neighbors are all types of people. There's not any, uh,

any type of person I've ever excluded in my life for any reason. Um,

I was influenced a lot by native Americans as a child.

I don't know, uh, if that's like, uh,

because they have their own reservations and communities and,

and stuff like that. I don't know if I'm like switching to an urban

environment. Um, if I'm behind the times,

but because that word just changed a month ago, you know,

it can't be that big of a deal. Uh, I, uh,

I'm going to keep working at it so I can make this thing as successful as

possible. Uh, anyway, thank you.

So I'm still stuck awake at night. I don't know when my sleep cycle should be. I've been,

I was able to break the bus. I was going to go all the way downtown, but I didn't make it.

So I just made it down to Mueller Lake Park. And I'm sitting out front of HEV,

kind of deciding what to do.

I'm doing pretty well on TikTok. I don't know what the next option I should take is.

You know, because TikTok has been so successful up to this point, if I could earn enough on it

to pay rent, I would go with, I would stick with TikTok. But if not, you know, if I can do interviews,

cameos, and sell merchandise, then it would probably pay enough to be an actual salary.

As it sits right now, it's a little light. I've been running on that donation system

pretty heavy, but I don't know where, you know, what places I can be. Like I said,

the last time I got in the wrong position, I became homeless for three years. So I really

have to be careful not to upset anyone, because the second I upset anyone, I'm homeless.

I don't have any way to say or do anything. I'm doing my best to climb up the ladder, but

you know, if I make one wrong step, I'm homeless. So it's pretty difficult to climb this thing.

I'm doing my best. My face is still cleared up. I have to make sure, like, exactly what just

happened at Goodwill, it didn't work. You know, I tried to talk to everyone there. It lasted two

days. It didn't work. I work constantly. I don't think I ever have a day off from anything. It's

always awake work until I pass out. And then, you know, how my sleep cycle is all over the place,

this is all work. I'm working at constantly. So being well-endowed, you know, that limits

my possibilities. I know no one wants to believe me on here, but it's the truth. So I'm stuck only

being certain places, and those certain places have to pay, which is what's making this so difficult.

Now, I was going back through Beverly Hills, California, and how the only time I was ever

able to receive a large sum of money was in Beverly Hills, because the entire city of Beverly Hills

is based around kids who have wealthy parents, and the wealthy parents, you know, pay the kids,

or the kids get their portion of the inheritance. In my case, it's the exact opposite.

My mom keeps all the inheritance, and anything I earn from any job, she also steals.

So it's that big of a reversal, and I don't know if it's worth the effort going to Beverly Hills

just to sit there and use their system to push into my mom and anyone she's associated with

to clear her off of all this stolen money, stolen properties, stolen possessions

that she's been doing for for years and years and years. I don't know, you know, if I could

even find housing in Beverly Hills to do that again. It did work the first time, but I was

sleeping in the hedges just outside, just on the park where that Beverly Hills sign is. So I just

hide in the hedges at night and then walk around during the day, and the whole thing like caught

on its own and brought $40,000 in from the library. So I would do that and then walk into the library

and sit there, and the whole mechanism like caught, and I was able to pull in $40,000 that

was in a foreign bank account. So it has proven to have worked previously, but going there, you know,

without enough money and without enough money coming in, I'll end up homeless in LA again,

and I don't know how long it would take to dislodge everything my parents created that

has driven me bankrupt numerous times. In Nevada, you know, everyone reads the Bible out there, so

it's like honor thy mother or mother and father, but if your mother's a thief, she just steals

everything you own and threatens your life. So it's impossible for that to work, you know.

The Beverly Hills system has worked in the past, but it's difficult to trust because then,

you know, you end up with a pile of money with no like infrastructure around it. So

you just have cash without infrastructure. The last time I got that $40,000, I bought a van

and just ended up like coasting around the country all over the place until I went bankrupt

again. So Austin is considerably more trustworthy, but it doesn't have the firepower of Beverly Hills

to just fire the money through like they can. So I'm gonna sit here, probably walk around tonight,

see what videos I can make, and see what I can do. Anyway, thank you.

I've been looking at phones with unlimited data, and I can go up to Total, which is another

Verizon company. This is a track phone. If I go up to Total, I can get the unlimited

data and then I can live stream and actually watch TikTok, rather than, you know, the hotel

Wi-Fi is really stuttery. So it's kind of sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't.

So I was looking at it, but the problem I'm having is, first off, the camera in this thing

has been having trouble focusing. And I tried to transfer this track phone over to Total.

It won't transfer over. For some reason, they can't get to go over. So it may be locked

to track phone, although, you know, they're both the same company. So it's, you know,

why? But secondly, you know, they would have to give me a new phone. The new phone is a

downgrade from the phone I'm currently using. So I don't think it's worth the switchover.

I'll just have to do lives in the hotel room. But I wish I could transfer to a phone with

a better camera and unlimited data easily. They were also telling me, you know, it's

40 bucks a month, then turned into 50 bucks a month. They said I could cancel any time,

but I don't see how they're giving me a free phone, and I'm able to cancel at any time.

So that's going to be the next one. You know, trying to do anything, why I like track phone

in the first place is you buy a card that lasts a month, and you buy a phone. And there's

no like weird system in it. Everything started going up in price the second I tried to transfer

over to an unlimited data, because I was asking, all right, month to month, no contract, unlimited

data. And who knows how many weird little things they have in there to make the price

go up. So this is really irritating. It's the same with like a car. You know, you get

a set price, and you, the price seems to like double by the time you try to, you know, get

a sign on the line. So these phones, you know, track phone has been great. I wish they

would offer unlimited data on it, just a month, you know, buy an unlimited data card, and

then have unlimited data. Because the simple buy a phone, buy a month of service, there's

no like weird add-ons or price hikes or anything like that. So I'm going to stick with track

phone for the time being. It's been doing a good job. I wish everyone in the cell phone

industry, the automotive industry, and everywhere else would cool it with this, it's set at

one price, and then the price seems to double when you try to buy the thing. You know, what

is that? So anyway, I'm tired of it. Anyway, thank you.

So I was able to get money and I'm very appreciative of it. I got a prescription for

what was supposed to be jock itch ringworm but it's not doing anything for the itch

like whatsoever. The itch got out of control again. I tried for two days with her a day

and the itch was just absurd. So I had to switch back to the jock itch fungal over-the-counter

treatment. I think it was more for bruising and rashes that involve like

kind of rubbing and heat and irritation and stuff like that.

This is a pretty tough fungal infection so that's why I'm stuck with it.

I also got this money in but I'm not buying anything. I feel like I have to save up for

everything. So like I was looking at a cell phone the second I wanted to buy a cell phone

then there was a contract that they didn't even tell me. They just walked me out the store

but then there was a contract when I tried to get a phone with unlimited data so I could do

lives outside. So that's out. I was thinking about bicycle too. I could get a little farther maybe

get better footage with a bicycle but it's dangerous. Walking with shoes you're going

two miles an hour you know maybe you'll trip something like that but a bicycle you're going

20 miles an hour you're bouncing on two wheels and there's cars everywhere so I'm really hesitant

on getting a bicycle. If I had a bike path nearby you know then maybe but then I need the bike path

to be able to go somewhere that I need to be which you know where do I need to be is

is where I am so wherever money is is where I need to be and I don't know if a bicycle will

take me to where where money is whereas TikTok is doing a great job at it you know I just need

to keep talking and yelling and telling my life story into this thing until we can all work

together on resolving each other's problems which is going to be the next step. You know doing

interviews, cameos, having people on this very page which hasn't happened yet. I know it's got

83,000 followers and been going for two years and no one else has ever been on the channel

other than like two guys like one guy stood behind me one time and another another time I panned to

a street performer who's playing music. Those are the only two other people that have been on here

so as soon as I get out of whatever box I'm in I will have more people on this

and do interviews, cameos, and try to teach people how I got this thing to work

and how to be successful with it where you know in my case the the need from the beginning

was I wasn't able to talk enough in every situation I was in you know I just couldn't talk

like I said I was from Nevada from the casinos I don't know if it's a gigantic

mute thing where you just get pressed down so much you get muted so you can't talk at all but

that's why I had to go sit on the side of the road for three years just so I could talk unfiltered

and tell people what I'm going through so I'm gonna walk around a little more tonight burn off

a little just it's not quite anger it's it's more angst and and maybe light aggression you know

uh it's kind of just if you get some exercise you burn it off really well

and because I'm doing this content creator filmography uh digital diary on here

um walking around doesn't hurt because maybe I'll come up with a

clip or something while I'm walking so anyway thank you

I'm going through promotions, how to promote this channel, how to make it successful,

how to earn like a full-time living off the thing. It seems to be going pretty well,

so I'm very appreciative of the support and donations. But now, you know, I'm getting

messages that are spam and scams, and I'm trying to avoid anything that could be fraud or

a identity theft is the other one that seems to be coming through. So I have to be careful

what messages I respond to and which ones I don't. I'm trying to pick and choose through

who's like trying to have an honest conversation and who's just a scammer.

That's what I'm going through with the channel now. I'm trying to get, you know, more

interesting content on here, but I'm still stuck in this mid-gear. I'm walking around

the University of Austin at Texas now and just seeing if I can socialize. I know a big

part of the audience is 20-something in college, and everyone's trying to make

a successful TikTok page. This one kind of went on its own. I just, you know, I was sitting on

the side of the road in Florida with a tablet and just decided, well, maybe I'll upload a video.

That video, it didn't do anything. I think it got 200 views, but it got my radio communication

working where I was able to email my mom and then get a hotel room paid for. I've been in the hotel

room ever since, just while my face clears. I don't know what happens when my face clears, but

once it clears, then who knows? I may have more opportunities available.

But the actual videos that started doing well were just random what I was thinking

that day, what I was going through, unfiltered talking about it into the camera, and then just

uploading it without any sort of second thought. So that has run into its own issues

where I have to be careful what I say on here. I don't want to offend anyone. So now I'm gonna

have to start going through speech lessons to make sure no one gets offended by whatever I

was thinking that day. So because I'm running so unfiltered in this thing, that creates a risk

that I have to be careful about. Now, I don't have any negative thoughts or any thoughts that should be

filtered anyway, but being ignorant about certain... if a certain word changes

definition or meaning and no one tells me about it, there's no way for me to know that. So my

thoughts and intent can be completely clear and pure, but if I don't have the information

ahead of time, there's nothing I can do about it. So I have to be careful about that.

That's the risk I'm running into with this thing, but it should, you know, it's succeeded for

this long, so I might as well keep working at it and see how far I can get myself. Anyway, thank you.

Made my way back to the Moody Center and, uh, because I slept all day, you know, I decided,

well, maybe I'll go back down there and see what's going on. It looks like they have some

sort of show going on, but I don't know what it is. They wouldn't let me in. Uh, I, uh, I just

asked to use the bathroom and they said, um, without a ticket, you know, I can't go in.

So I was going to record a TikTok clip in there, but I'm not going to push it.

I don't want to upset anyone here because, uh, for about a year and a half in Boise, Idaho,

I worked as event staff security for, uh, rock concerts and various events at the basketball

court at Boise State University. Now this University of Texas in Austin, um, is very

similar. This Moody Center is incredibly similar to what was Taco Bell Arena in Boise. I think it's

arena now or something, but, uh, it's very similar. So I have some experience working

event staff and security in this environment. So I think that's, what's drawn me to the Moody

Center. Plus, you know, I had a video do really well on here sitting out front of the Moody Center.

Um, so, uh, I'm sitting back down here again to see what's going on. Uh, I, uh, I don't know if,

uh, if a rinky dink little part-time job working here at the Moody Center would, uh, get in the

way of TikTok. TikTok's going pretty well. I'm working on merchandise sales of shirts

and, uh, I don't know what else, you know, whatever makes money, cameos, interviews,

I'm doing lives as much as possible, but I can only last like, uh, 35, 40 minutes of live.

I'm trying to get them longer, but I'm getting in so many arguments that I need to, uh, keep

working at it so I can get the lives running a little smoother. Also, you know, I'm using a phone

that doesn't have any data whatsoever. So I have to use the wifi for, uh, uh, live streaming. And

if I had a phone with data, I could probably, uh, get more live streams going. It would be more

interesting, uh, to watch. So anyway, thank you.

I'm still going through everything wrong and as you can see my face broke out is still breaking

out a little bit. My lip, I got a cold sore or a canker sore on my lip and I'm still fighting

off this jaw itch and I don't even know if it classifies as jaw itch anymore because I've been

through, I went through two months with the Lotrimin over-the-counter fungal cream and spray

and ringworm cream and then two months of the EmuAid Max fungal cream from Amazon

and now I've started the, with no success, the second I stop taking the medication or stop

applying the cream, everything starts itching like crazy again. So it's just all itching

everywhere. Now I've switched to a prescription strength or prescription cream and oral anti-itch

medication and I was able to do a doctor questionnaire on TikTok to get the prescription to

get the prescriptions filled. So I got the prescriptions filled and was,

am trying that now but the second you know I stop applying it, it starts itching like crazy again

and the spots are still on my legs that are that are small but noticeable. So I'm going through

that. I don't know, this has been a fight to get through this fungal infection quote unquote if it

is even a fungal infection. You know now it could be anything. It really looks like a fungal

infection. When I match up the pictures online, I was going to show video on here. I even tried to

make a video but it's too much. You know I can't show all of that plus I'm trying to keep my TikTok

channel as clean as possible. I did the mole one on here you know that and that just showed me with

my shirt off and you know I could kind of sense the backlash from it. So I'm not doing the the

fungal infection one but along my waist there's a big fungal spot that I wanted to show but am

unable to. So it is there. I'm taking two showers a day with fungal shampoo on top all of that. You

know I have fungus soap that I lather on morning and night to help try to get rid of it. I've been

doing the entire time. So this this is the worst part of the whole thing is this this fungal

infection. I haven't been able to get an STD tech check. I can't get to a doctor or hospital. I'm

kind of stuck on individual little tracks. So I could go on the bus to like I can go to the

university and upload a video and I can go to the like park in ATB and that's really it. You know

that's that's as far as I can get the bus to go. So I'm mostly stuck in this hotel room

which gives me time to to clean all this up because it is an actual infection that I haven't

been able to get rid of for months now and that's been going on for 20 years. Like I said before in

one of the previous videos you know I was working at Fry's Electronics I think and I went on online

dating and went on a date with one girl and then went on a date with another girl and got with the

second one and then the next thing you know I had jock itch and chlamydia and I got rid of the

chlamydia but the jock itch remains and this was when I was 20. So it it has been that long of a

process trying to get rid of it. Before you know I couldn't talk about it or I couldn't talk at all

so it was muted the entire time. Once I got TikTok working and then started telling speeches on TikTok

that got me talking so much I could finally bring up this jock itch to hopefully get it resolved.

I'm going to keep working at it. I don't think there's any other physical or mental

ailments whatsoever other than this jock itch. The the well-endowed thing does put me in a

different category I guess but the the jock itch fungal infection is you know kind of in the way

and I'm having trouble getting rid of it. So I'm just going to keep doing you know I'm going to

keep saying I have this infection and keep trying to get treatments in that resolve it.

But so far it's ineffective you know like I was saying it just starts itching so bad the second

I stop putting any treatment on it that it's it's it's rough to say the least. So that should

be you know I've had STD tests in in the past and I did come up with cold sore you know as I

was saying I'd had a cold sore in two years while I got one that may be a cold sore maybe a canker

sore just on my lip. I was picking at my lip so I don't know if that just caused an infection on its

own. I'm putting it's probably just a canker sore but I'm putting you know I have treatment for it

too so I'm just throwing and I'm getting the moles removed with mole remover that I had to throttle

because the mole remover is so effective all the moles start bleeding. So I'll have bloody moles

all over my body and it gets all over the sheets so I have to you know I had to slow down the

mole remover just so I didn't have because they they will bleed for hours and cause all

sorts of problems. So I had to throttle back the mole remover to not remove them all at once just

to get them slowly it kind of eroded away. So that's what I'm going through now anyway thank you.

So I made my way to this Mexican bar.

I swear, if you dressed it up a little bit, you would end up with the exact replica of the bar from the movie From Dusk Till Dawn.

I'll do a quick pan around of the thing.

It's right down the street from me.

So, it is really cool.

I gotta give them credit for building this thing.

Because there was a Buffalo Wild Wings next door.

Or down the street a little bit.

And it went out of business.

And I wondered what would Buffalo Wild Wings have, isn't it?

Well, it was this thing.

There are so many people in here.

And it is like the perfect Mexican party bar.

So, it would be cool to get a From Dusk Till Dawn thing going.

But, I don't know. It's running so well the way it is.

They did a good job.

Anyway, thank you.

Because I'm still new to this whole thing, you know, before I was just doing tech work and I

worked for a few retail stores and, I don't know, did security and event staff for rock concerts

and music events and all sorts of other events, I'm still new to this being on camera. Like,

I didn't start out doing this when I was young, you know. There's a learning curve to it.

And I'm going through, like, the social structure of the thing and all the paths I can take. And

one of those paths, you know, there's two directions to go in.

One is I work on support structure, which is like everyone

helping and everyone involved with the success of this TikTok page. And the other is I just go

around and harass other celebrities. And I don't know if having like 85,000 followers or whatever

is on this thing classifies as celebrity or fame. It might be, you know, it's probably in the gray

area somewhere. It's TikTok fame, but, you know, there's still a few followers there. So it has

some success to it. I have opted for the option of just not harassing. You know, I like living

my life not harassing anyone in the first place, let alone celebrities. So I don't know if this

TikTok page has enough punch to it to get in the higher up social circle. I'm probably going to

keep working on foundation and, you know, go around and talk to people that send

requests. I'm trying to get into the comments. You know, I'm trying to answer comments as much

as possible, but that thing piled on so much that I'm just like, now I have to stay out of it.

I have to stay on my own comments section. I'm trying to, like, get back into the comments, but

I have been answering DMs and I'm trying to build a strong foundation of support.

And the best way to do that is just talk to people who are helping.

The other path is this kind of be a paparazzi and go around and almost harass other celebrities.

Hustle other celebrities would be the way to put that. And I just don't want to go that way.

I'm going to stick with, you know, answering questions on here and comments and not be a

bother because I know they must have some, like, issue with that because I'm learning how to do

film production and potentially acting, although I don't know. I know my life story would be,

you know, you might be able to get a movie out of the thing or a few movies or just work in the

movie industry. It doesn't even have to be my life story. I seem to draw a camera anyway,

so that probably helps. And I've just been using that camera draw to make this TikTok page

successful. Getting involved with other people in the industry, like, I was walking around

the university but, you know, I fall under the college student category because I'm just not

very well educated in film production. I could probably learn and I could probably

learn how to write and potentially do comedy and maybe help produce a major motion picture.

But I don't know the best path to get my foot in the door. The next step I was planning on taking

with this channel and with my life is just working on fitness and exercise to

stay in good shape and have, you know, more to talk about on this page. So anyway, thank you.

As I've said before, I got a pretty successful video in from the University of Texas. You know,

paranoid about STDs and how to treat STDs and all that stuff. So I got some money in from that. It

doesn't come in until the 15th, but I think I'm looking at about $4,000 out of that paycheck.

And now, how to spend the money is the next thing to go through. Because,

you know, I think my hotel is still going to keep getting paid regardless. And I'm just buying food.

So that money, you know, the last time I had, I got $100 in while I'm sitting on the side of the road.

And I was sitting in front of a gas station and a guy gave me $100. I'm like,

I hadn't seen $100 in a year at that point. And I thought, well, maybe I should, you know, invest

this wisely because it's so much money at once that I went out and bought a tablet, you know,

just a $60 tablet from Walmart and a pair of headphones. And I put TikTok on the thing. And

that's what started this whole TikTok page and channel and what dug me out off the side of the

road. Just, you know, TikTok doing so well kind of hoisted me out from homelessness. So that's

what started the success I'm running on. And now, you know, if I get $4,000 in, that's the most

money I've seen in years and years and years. So now this has got me to a hurdle that I don't

quite know what to do. But I'm thinking along the same principle as buying that tablet with $100

because I hadn't seen $100 in a while and a tablet, you know, I could start

potentially creating content, which is what I thought at the time,

or just getting into contact with people that could help. So now with this $4,000, you know,

I'm thinking what big purchase could I make that would carry me to the same level that that tablet

did that became successful. And the only thing I can figure is an e-bike, you know, electric

bicycle, I'd be able to get around town and maybe able to get into, you know, higher end social

circles and, you know, be part of the community in some way. So I'm looking at electric bicycles

all over the place and I won't get the money until the 15th. So I'm just browsing around

different stores. But I had, as a child, I was really good at BMX bikes. Like we would jump them,

I don't know, really high, you know, really high for a kid. I can't remember, probably six feet in

the air or something. But when you're eight years old, six feet is really high. So we would have

a ball on BMX bikes. Then my mom ended up buying a Specialized Hard Rock. And this is where her

weird involvement in everything. She bought a men's Specialized Hard Rock. I think it had

something to do with me riding those BMX bikes. But she said it was hers. And then when I went

to high school, she let me borrow it for high school and then took it back after I graduated.

So anything to do with my mom is like this. So I have a lot of experience on Specialized Bicycle

without actually owning the bicycle. Although I don't know if she earned it or not.

So this is another thing, you know, every one of her things. This is why I avoid her entirely.

But it gave me a lot of experience with Specialized. So I was looking at the Specialized

bikes. They have one on sale for two grand. But there's also another electric bike store called

Bike Farm that has used electric bicycles. So I'm going to go look at them and see what

they got. You know, I was hoping if I could spend two grand on a bike, electric bike,

that really might hoist me to this level of TikTok following I have. Because I'm looking

at the other people that have followings like this on TikTok and they're way better than I am

at like everything. So I'm going to have to act a lot. But I like playing the game of seeing how

high I can climb without causing any problems. So that's what I'm doing now. And we'll see how it

goes. Anyway, thank you.

So I went out and took a walk tonight. I slept for a few hours, like mid-afternoon to evening,

so now I'm wide awake. And I ate at Panda Express earlier, which was extremely good,

because I haven't eaten fast food in a long time again. I've just been eating Walmart frozen food,

so every time I get a fast-meal mood, food, meal, it's really good. Anyway, though,

that brought me to another story. The last time I had Panda Express, I think I was homeless in

Calamingo's, a morongo casino near, in that area. There's a whole outlet store there

that is on I-10, but just outside of Los Angeles, but before Palm Springs. So there's a big, like,

desert strip. And I was trying to walk out to Palm Springs, but getting stuck, because it was a good

20 miles or 30 miles after that spot to get to the next drinking fountain. So I finally had to

stockpile on water and pile a bunch of water in my backpack and take, like, a day walk over to

Palm Springs, which I did finally make it. But I was stuck at that Calamingo's for quite a while.

And the reason I was homeless, I think, you know, there's multiple reasons, but two of the main

reasons that I may be responsible for. One was I was overweight. I'm now remembering what the whole

model mold is supposed to look like. And I was way over. I was probably 220, 230.

So I was way over. I didn't need food, but I thought I needed food. And the second thing I had,

I was so unbelievably addicted to cigarettes that I had run out of money completely,

and run out of people to beg, and then just started walking around aimlessly looking for

leftover cigarettes. And it was the worst. But well, it wasn't even the worst, you know,

it because after having such a huge party in Las Vegas, with so much alcohol, so many women,

so many bright, exciting nights, depression becomes a concern. And I didn't want to let

myself you know, I see others get in that like depressed state. And I didn't want to see myself

fall into that. So I ended up just, you know, going with the leftover cigarette thing and

walking around aimlessly because no matter what happened, I wasn't getting depressed. You know,

it just it didn't happen. There was too much like wild, everything going on, that it was impossible

to get depressed in any way. So it worked for that reason. It also worked because other than

potentially blipping illicit drug use, I'd never done any drugs. I stayed away from them as much

as possible. And the reason I was able to stay away was because I was so addicted to cigarettes,

and I really liked alcohol, that you know, I just didn't have any desire to do any drugs because

cigarettes were my sole addiction. And it worked for that reason really well. You know, I never

went near drugs, didn't didn't want them. But I still was, you know, quote unquote, in the addict

category. It was just for cigarettes, you know, it was just cigarettes. And it was probably rigged,

you know, maybe I like subconsciously rigged it. So I only only wanted cigarettes just so nothing

worse would come in. But while I was out there, there was a Panda Express there. And the trash

can at the Panda Express was always full of leftovers. So I could have five gourmet meals

of leftover Panda Express out of the trash can and get fatter. You know, I was gaining weight there.

It was so much leftover Panda Express. And I, that brought all that up when I just ate at Panda

Express, which was sort of depressing. But that was the only way through at the time. So that's

what I had to go through. I, I'm trying to walk around to burn off the last of the angst and

see how it goes. Anyway, thank you.

Back when I was younger and through a lot of Vegas, I would play a lot of pool. I never got

very good at it, but, you know, when at our ranch, I think we had a pool table at the ranch,

so I'd sit there and play pool all day on it. But I made my way to a bar that has a few pool tables,

and I haven't worked up the nerve to actually play, but it sure is nice. You know, this was

always one of my favorite games. My favorite bar game was pool. I never got into much of the other

stuff that much. Yeah, I know there's like shuffleboard and darts and all that, but pool

was the only one that kept my attention for any amount of time. So I'm gonna sit here and

see if I can get a game going. I don't have much money, so I'm trying to be careful with what I

spend and what I buy. And because that money is coming in on the 15, I'm trying to save everything

for an e-bike, which I just spent all day looking at e-bikes and talking to people,

and found a really good one for $1,800 that looks like it can haul a lot on the back of it.

It has 100-pound weight capacity on the rear rack, so you can haul 100 pounds on the back of the

thing, which is really good. I mean, that's a lot of groceries. And it has a throttle,

and I think it goes 20 miles an hour. It goes in eco mode, like 60, 70 miles. So it's a really

good form of transportation, especially in Austin. It should be able to fit on the bike racks,

on the bus. It's very inexpensive transportation. I don't need a license. I don't need insurance.

I don't need any sort of registration. It's just a vehicle that does its job.

And I can go all over the city with it, which is what I need it for.

So that's probably what I'm going to go with. I just went through the whole thing, you know,

the guys' bike, girls' bike thing of, you know, guys' bikes have the top bar and girls'

bikes have the step through. Well, now it seems to be blurred quite a bit where everything is a

step through. I was going to get the top bar one. The reason for having the top bar on the thing

is whenever you put any weight on the bike, like how this would go before, you know, if you weigh

a lot, you'll just bend the frame on the bike going over weight capacity. So they're telling me

without that top bar, it's still, you know, at 200 pounds with maybe another 30, 40 pounds

on my back or on the luggage compartment of it. I won't have any frame issues. You know,

I won't bend the frame. I won't break the frame. There should be no issues there. This is the

biggest concern with that bike is that I'm just going to bend the frame. You know, I go off a

curb or whatever, hit a bump and bend the frame on it. So I'm going to do some research on it.

I don't know. Maybe the new ones don't have the same issue the old ones did where you would just

bend it or break it, or you'd have these cracks that would show in the welds, which is why I was

trying to steer towards the ones with the welded in top bar that holds the bike together.

But it's one of those cruiser style electric bikes and it's extremely comfortable. It is

the most comfortable bicycle I've ever sat on. And it almost feels like a motorcycle.

You get that motorcycle vibe from the thing. Everything's going to remind me of a motorcycle.

So, you know, having a bicycle with a motor on it, you know, you've got a motorcycle,

but I know it only goes 20 miles an hour. The other thing, they had a few other ones in there,

but they didn't have a rear brake light. And this one did. And it was extremely difficult to put a

rear brake light on the bike. So I had to steer towards the one that has the factory rear brake

light because that makes all the difference in the world. If you're riding at night and you want

cars to see you, you need that rear brake light. So I was pretty happy to see it had that. Anyway,

thank you.

I made my way over to Topgolf, which was right down the road from that bar I was at.

And I just couldn't go by this place without filming a clip of it.

I asked the guys downstairs where and what I could film.

And he told me the company policy was, as long as I don't film any of the technology or any of the people without their consent,

I can film the green.

So I'm watching the golf ball sail out there.

And this is an impressive driving range.

This is another one of those things, you know, when I was growing up in Winnemucca, we would go out to Reno.

And the casino at the time was called Valleys, which now I think it's called the Grand Sierra.

But they have a huge reservoir with little islands you can hit golf balls on that was a lot of fun.

Especially, you know, when you're young, it's like the most exciting thing in the world.

Coming from, you know, land, open desert, you know, having a big reservoir to hit golf balls in was a lot of fun.

So I've always enjoyed driving ranges.

Now, I'm not very good at it.

I know there's a scoring system with this Topgolf one, but I don't quite know how it works.

I'm just walking around, like, trying to find footage to upload on here to keep the channel going.

But as I, you know, socialize more, you know, I'm still working on the socializing thing.

As I socialize more, I should be able to get in more and get more interesting content to put up here.

So anyway, thank you.

Everywhere I go I feel like I have to leave five minutes after I got there,

including the bus stop. You know, it's everywhere. I can't sit still any possible place, so I have to

walk incredibly long distances to do anything. I was trying to look at e-bikes, maybe get some

better footage with one of them, maybe get my foot in the door in some kind of social circle

that would work, but now I'm getting more and more reluctant about getting one. It's obviously to

appease someone. You know, I have to appease someone with everything I do, so the e-bike is

also to appease someone. It's difficult with all these cars trying to ride one of those things

safely. You know, there's so much traffic and no one can see it, and I can't see what the drivers

are doing, so I have to be exceptionally cautious on foot, and that's just walking. So going 20,

28 miles an hour on one of those e-bikes, I'm having trouble finding the safe safest path to

take. I still haven't, I can't reach a doctor at all. I can't go anywhere near a hospital or doctor.

The last time I tried, I went to the hospital and waited and then tried to secure funding

and then felt compelled to leave like always because I can only sit in a place for five

minutes before, you know, some push goes off and I have to leave again. So then had to leave. Then a

week later, they said they were going to charge me $500 for sitting there when I didn't get any

treatment whatsoever. Sat in the lobby for an hour and they charged me $500 that, you know, I never

got a conclusion on. I called and argued with them about, you know, I sat in the guest lobby

waiting to see if I could get funding to get a medical evaluation and then couldn't get funding

and left and they charged me $500. And now I'm completely jammed up because I got all this money

donated in but I can't physically go to the hospital. I end up looking for e-bikes and

and going to the bar and everything but getting a doctor's physical and an STD test. And the last

time when I had funding to try to get an STD test, I made it to the university and it was

absolutely terrifying to try to walk in to the STD clinic. Who knows what that is?

Uh, it's uh, it's like absurd how difficult every little thing is. I don't know if I'm working,

I'm trying to work with the system and working against it somehow or how the thing is supposed

to work because no one will explain anything to me. I'm going around talking to everyone in the

city and it jams all weird and I have to leave and uh with no explanation. Like for instance,

at McDonald's I get a uh order at the table. So I was sitting at table 110. I ordered the meal

at table 110. They uh, they brought it in a to-go bag whereas everyone else had trays.

So that made me feel rushed to eat my food at McDonald's. I don't know if there's something

going off with me and no one else but I'm doing everything as transparent and honest as I

possibly can and yet here I am walking miles back to the hotel room because I can't sit still long

enough to wait for the bus to get there. Who knows what that is? Everyone's gonna say I need

psychiatric evaluation and and I'm schizophrenic and and oh no, who knows what else? This is the

best I can do. I have a massive job history with uh all sorts of rehires and uh great reviews

but how I got jammed in whatever this gear is to where nothing can be accomplished is strange.

So that's my rant for the night. Anyway, thank you.

The amount of fraud I'm having to go through on this thing is a joke.

So I'll get messages, you know, I'll get DMs, and I try to reply to them all.

The latest one was some woman posing as a gym instructor, or actually being a gym instructor,

offered to send me, you know, like a t-shirt and a water bottle in the mail.

So I'm like, yeah, sure, whatever. Here's my address. Gave her my address.

Then they said in two days someone's going to show up and expect $500.

Like some sort of extortion, I don't know, fraud. You know, crime. You know, just crime in general.

So someone's going to show up at the hotel in two days and demand $500 for delivery of a t-shirt and a water bottle

that she claimed to be giving to me without acknowledging the delivery quote-unquote fee.

And this is absolute fraud.

So this is what I'm going through in the DMs and the back end of this thing.

What seems to be a reoccurring theme between all of them is they all seem to threaten to show up at my front door,

which I'm really getting tired of.

I don't know. You know, having people, this goes off everywhere.

You'll have some guy threatening to show up at your front door and like assault you or something.

It happens all the time. I've been through it a hundred times. It's really getting old.

So if there's a way to counter this, I'm all ears.

It's just the constant threat of someone showing up at the front door over and over again.

This latest one is demanding $500. He's going to show up at the front door and demand $500 or else.

You know, or some kind of threat, violence, you know, whatever.

So this is what I'm going through.

I'm open to ideas about how to handle it.

You know, if it wasn't happening every day almost, I wouldn't have that big of an issue.

But it's constant.

You know, every time it's the same thing.

So I'm open to ideas on here on how to counter it.

Anyway, thank you.

So I didn't do anything this year for Halloween.

It's been quite a few years since I had a real Halloween and I don't know,

you know, I think I'm better off. Um, during the Vegas days,

uh, you know, Halloween was a big deal, but, um, uh,

ever since I left, you know, it hasn't been anything.

I haven't really done anything for Halloween and, uh,

maybe it's for the better, you know, it helps, it helps, uh,

potentially me sleep at night. Although tonight, you know,

I wasn't able to sleep. I've been going through like, you know,

what bars to go to,

what places to be that don't tear me down too much.

So like bars with,

with too many cigarette smokers because I was able to

quit smoking, um,

a few months ago and I'm shrinking down vape quite a bit.

Uh, you know,

I'm avoiding places with too many cigarette smokers cause I don't,

I don't want to be exposed to just start smoking again. So, uh,

because of that, you know, I'm avoiding those bars.

The second thing is, you know,

some of these nights that are party nights where you stay out all night, um,

and drink heavily is another thing I've probably been overexposed to in the past

anyway. So, uh,

going back into it, you know,

trying to keep that in moderation as well.

Skipping nights like Halloween really help. Um,

because I don't have these over the top, uh,

party nights that just throw off everything. You know,

the only thing I ever got out of them was just everything being thrown off,

you know, your work schedule, your sleep cycle, um,

everything, uh, getting thrown off. So, uh, I'm,

I'm trying to stick with this game plan and we'll just see how it goes.

But, uh, you know,

I'm going to feel better tomorrow after not having a drink excessively tonight.

So anyway, thank you.

Ever since leaving Boise, like I think I was 34, maybe 33, I worked for the

university there as event staff at the rock concerts. And I was getting dates off of online

dating, you know, kind of the same as always. But I don't know what happened. You know, I had that

jock itch. I don't know if it was some weird paranoia that I started getting worried about

giving people jock itch and wanted to get it clear. But I was there for like a year and a half

and then had to give up. I went out and bought a Ford. I don't know if that has something to

do with it. But I went out and bought a Ford and that like switched the mechanism I was operating

under from, you know, I was driving a Toyota Tacoma before it and I switched to a Ford and I

was in like the Ford gear then. And that's when the whole thing kind of dumped. You know, everything

I own just kind of dumped. That ranch in Nevada, that's why I had the collision with my mom at the

ranch in Nevada. I had to leave everything behind. And then I had that little Ford C-Max for,

I don't know, a year or two. Drove around everywhere. For some reason it would jam up

online dating like you wouldn't believe. So I kept traveling around, went to Omaha and

Astoria, Oregon. And finally I ended up selling that old C-Max in Astoria, Oregon. Bought a Ford.

This is without being able to get a date with a woman anywhere. Bought a Ford F-150,

then hauled everything I owned out of Astoria, donated most of it. Still couldn't, you know,

couldn't get a date. I don't know what happened. I don't know if I dated too many women or what.

If I wasn't putting enough motivation into it or what. But this is still continuing,

that's why I'm telling the story. Then I drove the F-150, you know, I just suddenly got felt

or compelled or whatever and got geared up to Alaska. So drove the whole way up to Alaska after

donating everything I owned. And drove the Dalton, you know, drove all over Alaska.

Finally went bankrupt and had the vehicle towed and then they gave me enough for an airplane

ticket to fly back to LA. And I was in LA for like a year and a half completely homeless

and just couldn't get through whatever I needed to get through. And I don't know what that is.

You know, after that, then I bought a Ford E-350 van, ended up driving around all over the place,

sleeping in it, ended up going bankrupt in Central Florida and then having the van towed

and never seeing it again. And all my belongings went with it that time too.

And ended up begging on the side of the road with a sheet of cardboard until I got a tablet. Now

you upload a video to TikTok on the tablet. And that's what got me picked up to a hotel room.

But still, you know, going from, in my 30s, in my 20s, I was getting with a lot of women. Then

my 30s, I got, you know, up until I was 34, I was doing fine. But the whole thing caved in.

And ever since, I'm 42 now. And ever since I was 34, you know, haven't had a date. So I don't know.

You know, I've been thinking, I've been working on myself and like trying to fix everything wrong.

But I don't know what that is. If something just glitched in my head or what,

where I wasn't putting enough effort into it. But I'm still kind of going through that. My whole

prerequisite for women is, and I still have this jock itch, you know. If I'm trying to do everything,

I'm going from who knows what criminal system to a law-abiding one. So during that long transition,

it's more difficult. Because before, I was using the casinos. I was using the concerts

to pick up girls. Whereas now, you know, I'm not using any of that. Plus, I had a pretty

good-sized arsenal. And I sold the entire thing all at once, two weeks after my dad passed away.

So just sold every weapon I owned just to stay out of it. You know, I didn't want the liability

of all these old weapons sitting there. So, and you know, who knows how reliable they were.

So I sold them all. And I think that's part of what caused the whole thing to cave in.

Now, I don't want to buy anything now. I'd rather just tell my life story. But that might have

something to do with it too. So that's what I'm going through. I'm not trying to upset anyone.

I'm still fighting off this jock itch that won't go anywhere. So I'm working on it. And just

message me on here if you have any questions or comments or issues. Anyway, thank you.

I'm standing out what will soon to be a 7-Eleven, although I don't know how long it's going to take.

I've been here like two years and they've been building this 7-Eleven building for two years.

It said right behind me, I don't know what's going on. You know, a lot of the construction

projects here seem like they're taking like a ridiculously long amount of time and this 7-Eleven

is one of those. So maybe it just takes that long to build one. I don't know. It seems to be a long

process for building one little, one little convenience store. But I've been going through,

you know, I got a few bucks in from that last video and I still haven't spent anything.

I still, I bought a t-shirt, a pair of pants, and a sweatshirt. And I think total I have a thousand

in cash and then another $3,700 coming in from the video on the 15th. So that's how much money

I'm looking at. I haven't been to a dentist in years. I've been, it's been a long time since

I was in a dentist, had a physical, and had or had a STD check. Those are three that are hanging over

me. I'm still, you know, I can't go straight to the STD check for some reason. I have to go through

some process beforehand. And it looks like the first step is going to the dentist to get my

teeth looked at because I have two cavities in my front two teeth. That's probably from too much

Mountain Dew. Maybe, maybe alcohol didn't help. I don't know. I haven't been drinking that much. So

it's probably the Mountain Dew. I don't know if vape affects it in any way. But, you know, my

getting these two spots in my two front teeth looked at would be nice. I'm also looking at

e-bikes to get around town to get better footage. Potentially get, you know, be able to be more

social because as it sits now, you know, I'm still being too antisocial. So that's not helping.

You know, having a bike is something to talk about. That's how it used to work with motorcycles. You

know, you have a motorcycle, then you, a bunch of guys have something to talk about rather than

just sitting there with nothing to say to each other. So that's how I was looking at the bicycles

and e-bikes. And, you know, Walmart has a regular bicycle for $98. And then the cheapest e-bike

that appears to be worthwhile is this Cannondale one for $2,000. So there's a big price jump in

how much it costs to buy a bike. And then I was looking at aftermarket kits for existing bikes.

And Walmart has them for $200. So I'm looking at like $350 out the door for an e-bike with

a aftermarket kit I install myself in the hotel room, which I probably can do. You know,

it doesn't seem like it would be that impossible to put together. The other one is, you know,

I can order one off of Amazon. Amazon has an e-bike for $200, but I don't know what I'm getting with

it. It's considerably cheaper than the Cannondale, but, you know, you don't get to see it. And I

don't know how big of a box that would be if the front desk would complain if I have a bicycle

ordered to the front. But it sure would help me get around. I'm trying not to work out my legs

too much. Because I've been on TikTok so much that that got me in what my physique should be.

And my legs are like gigantic as it is. So riding a bicycle around, you know,

get even more gigantic, which I don't need. You know, I'd rather work on upper body strength,

you know, have a normal upper body, good shape physique rather than gigantic legs and no upper

body whatsoever, which is where I am now. So that's why I was eyeing these e-bikes. And,

you know, even the one for $200, I think has a throttle on it. And it'll go for 30 miles

on the throttle. And you can buy extra batteries for it. So, you know, that's a lot of range without

having to pedal at all. And I was bringing up the Texas law on the thing. You don't need a license

or registration or insurance. But there are some bicycle laws you have to abide by. And one is I

don't think it can exceed 750 watt engine or motor and it can't go faster than 28 miles an hour.

And a lot of the e-bikes online, you know, some of them topped out at 36, had a 1500 watt motor on

them. So I had to be careful about that because, you know, one misclick and then you have an

illegal electric bicycle. I'd made that mistake before. I bought a Fat Moto motorized bicycle

that had a 79cc engine in it. And apparently the legal limit was a 49cc engine. So that

kicked me over in the illegal range without even really knowing it. So, you know, I have to be

careful about that because, you know, it's not designated anywhere on the bike that it exceeds

Texas e-bike speed regulations. And half of them were over 750 watt engine. So

anyway, I have to be careful about that. I'll keep working on it and see what comes up and

let everyone know. Anyway, thank you.

Well, it looks like I'm gonna have to end up using the money I made to pay for this hotel room

because now I don't know what's happened. My mom is no longer responding. I'm trying to use the

front-facing camera on this cell phone to see if that helps with the blur. It won't be as high res

but I was having too much trouble with that blur. You know, I give these speeches once and

just upload it. So it's the first try, first take of the speech to upload to the video.

Sometimes they're good, sometimes they're bad, but I get a much longer speech in when I do it the

first try. If I try to re-say the speeches, you know, it's always like half missing and

something's different. So I'm trying to do first try, first take every time. I wish I had a better

camera to do this with. I'm using a Motorola stylus and I was using the rear camera to try to

get higher quality footage, but I'm gonna switch it to the front camera because that last video

was bad. So anyway, thank you.

I was finally able to buy a bicycle. It wasn't easy. I ended up just giving up on all of it

and buying the cheapest full-frame bicycle Walmart had, and it was this Ozark Trail that

is a full frame. You know, I think it was $260 out the door. The tag on it said $100, but

you know, when you try to buy the thing, then it's two, three times as much. So it just has

the single front gear, which is one less thing to break, and then it doesn't have the front

suspension on it, which is another one less thing to break. These, speaking of brakes,

these disc brakes are, you know, maybe I can tune them a little bit. I've had a lot of bicycles

in the past, and you know, I've done some repairs to them. Not any surgery to a bicycle, but

basic tuning like brakes and gears and stuff like that. So I should be able to do all that to this

one when I get a toolkit for it and lights and a lock. So I just took it out now to ride it,

you know, a mile or two to make sure everything worked, and I'll keep working on it. But I'm going

through Texas law on bicycles and electric bicycles, because this is, the reason I went with

this one is I can convert it to an electric bike using one of the Walmart electric bike kits that

are like $200, $300, not that much. So, you know, $260 for the bike, another $300 for an e-bike kit,

you know, I'm at $600 total, which is pretty good. But the Texas law, I just learned this,

the Texas law only allows motors that are less than 750 watts or less. So most of those e-bike

kits have 1000 watt motors on them, which are illegal. And I've had this problem before,

I bought a motorized bicycle, a Fat Moto in Van Nuys, California, and it had a 79 cc motor on it,

not a 49 cc motor. And that, you know, the limit was 49 cc. So I have to be really careful about

what I purchase so it doesn't turn into a violation. Because, you know, all those little

ones add up. So I have to like do everything exactly calculated right to get through.

And so I have to find an e-bike kit that's 750 watts or less. And there were a few of them on

there. But, you know, I'm trying to maintain some power on this thing. So it'd be nice to find one

that is 750 watts. Now, you know, like the one they had in the store was 250 watt motor.

A lot of them have 500 watt motors. It goes all the way up to 1500 watts, which is way too much.

That's so far over the limit. You know, they go 40 miles an hour, 36 miles an hour, and the limit

of class two is like 28. And class one is 20. But with this kit, I'm pretty sure I get a throttle

and everything that makes it motorized. You know, so I can run that thing on throttle for

20-30 miles and have a second battery. You know, I can buy a second battery for those

aftermarket ones and have a second battery in my backpack and then have

60 miles of throttled range. You know, 60 miles only throttle without even pedaling.

So it's pretty good. It's a fun little industry to get myself into. It may get my foot in the

door where I need to be. But as for now, you know, I'm just sitting on a basic bike,

putting everything together, getting everything tuned so that it functions as a bicycle and I

learn exactly what the laws, the bicycle laws are so I don't end up in violation for any reason.

So anyway, thank you.

So I'm going through bicycle safety and I've been riding around, you know,

just burning off angst. I'm still stuck awake at night and I probably had two beers. I don't know

what the DUI limit on bicycles is. I think it's the same as riding a car or driving a car. And

so I think it's 0.08 or something. And I had two beers and then waited like an hour, hour and a

half and was still wide awake so decided to go out and ride the bike a little bit. And I know,

you know, it goes down, you know, so much per hour so I think I'm well under the limit. But it's

another thing, you know, every one of these little things goes off in my head before I do anything.

So I went out riding a little bit, been going on about bicycle safety, found a bicycle memorial

about someone, some woman who died on a bicycle. I didn't quite go through the whole thing

but I've been going through how to take this in the most safest possible way, this step

of riding a bicycle around just to get footage. You know, I'm just looking for anything interesting

to record on a cell phone and then upload to TikTok which is what I'm doing. So I'm out riding

around now trying to figure out what the best, what the safest and best path to take to get

footage is. And you know, there's multiple ways to ride this thing. You can ride on the sidewalk,

you can ride on the street with traffic. But I've been going on the sidewalk the whole time and I'm

like stopping at every bus stop and then waiting for the walk symbol and then kind of tiptoeing

across the street when the walk symbol starts. So I don't know. I think that's the legal option

but that's what I'm going through now. It is, I'm already getting to the hills and you know,

having an electric motor on it would make all the difference in the world.

But I'm not there yet. You know, I'm just riding it as a basic bicycle

around town. So I'm gonna try to order one of those kits and get an actual e-bike going.

I should, you know, like I said this bike was $260. I think I'm getting $3,700 in this month

from TikTok. So it's the most I've gotten in a month from TikTok. And because I only spent $260

on the bike, you know, now it's only another $400 for the conversion kit. Now I have to put the

whole thing together which I'll do in the hotel room and maybe I'll be able to video some of that

too just to get a fully functional e-bike going to see where that gets me. You know,

I don't know. There's some concerns with it. I might, you know, the bus rack, the front

bike holder on the bus only holds certain types of bikes. So if it has fenders or electric,

you know, electric assist, it may interfere with the holder's like bracket holding thing.

So I don't know. I'm gonna have to take a look at the bus holder, the bus bracket thing and see

what would interfere and what wouldn't. But I have a lot of bicycle experience. You know,

it came back to me instantly. I'm able to ride around for miles and miles without much issue.

You know, I'm just, my biggest concern is upsetting anyone. So I'm avoiding any residential

areas whatsoever. I don't go anywhere near residential areas and I'm sticking to the main

streets to ride around on just to not upset anyone. How I made it this far is just not upsetting

anyone. I'm sticking with that to make it. So I'm going to keep riding around tonight,

see if any footage I can find of interest comes in and upload on here. Anyway, thank you.

I made it downtown, you know, testing out the bike and how far I can get with it.

And there's three performers out, so I asked this guy if I could record him a little bit, playing music,

because I'm getting swept up in the guitar a little bit.

And he said fine, so...

That's just a taste of the Austin music scene.

I'm going through the bicycle still. I've got lights for it and a lock.

But I'm still trying to figure out which path to go on.

And stay out of everyone's way, as you can see.

So I'm learning the traffic laws as we go.

Like, another one I'm stuck at is when a light is red but there's a walk signal.

If you're in the bicycle lane, can you go on the walk signal or do you have to wait for the light to turn green?

Which I don't know, so I'm just waiting until the light turns green and then going to traffic.

But, you know, there's a bunch of little stuff I'm going to learn.

There's a big bike path down south here that I may or may not make it to.

But I was going to try to see it. It's probably better during the day.

So I'll come back during the day and check it out.

I'm trying to get, you know, as social as possible.

I've been sitting in that hotel room too much, so I'm happy to come out and see everyone around.

I'll go around and, you know, see if I can start up a conversation with anyone and get interviews and good footage to watch.

So anyway, thank you.

I'm going through this bicycle and after riding around all night last night, it had two

mechanical failures. First being, when I started to upload the first video, I didn't have the

kickstand down the whole way and it tipped over. So I was sitting on it and I didn't have the

kickstand down and it bent the kickstand into the rear brake, which it took forever to figure out.

Well, it probably took 20 minutes or so, but still a long time. So I was taking the whole thing apart.

I thought it was the brakes. I thought it was the rear tire was out of alignment.

I went through the whole thing and it was just that kickstand that got bent into the

the brake. So I had to bend it back to get the wheel to turn. But that was just after the

lightest little tip over. So I know I did buy the cheapest bike I could find and that's part of it.

The other thing that failed was I was just pulling up to a light and this front reflector

fell off. It just flung off the front tire. I went through this little plastic clip

that doesn't hold very well. I'm gonna get a piece of glue for it. But the brakes, you know, I'm still

going through. These are disc brakes on this bike. I'm used to those old clamp brakes

that they put on the front rim. But these disc brakes, they're nice, but I'm having

trouble adjusting them to the same level. It has this little knob up here for adjusting brakes,

but it doesn't seem to go far enough to make much of a difference. Plus the alignment, you know, you

have to keep the wheels perfectly aligned for disc brakes. I purposely bought this bike to

to be, you know, least amount of things falling off of it. That's why it doesn't have front suspension

and it only has a single front gear. So there's one less thing to start clicking

with just one front gear. So it just has the rear gear stack and I prefer that.

The amount of gears it has is plenty. You can go from a steep hill to like 25-30 miles an hour

with the gears that are on it. So it doesn't even need this front sprocket on the thing.

I'm hoping, you know, I'm looking at e-bike kits. It's going to be a lot of work to convert it,

but once that money comes in, it's probably going to go to a dentist, a jock itch fungal treatment,

and an e-bike kit. So those are going to be my three things. This should help get me footage.

Like I said, I put lights on it and I'm going through the lights. I don't have a proper tool

kit. So, you know, they're still sitting kind of loose. I was just using a little knife to thread

them in, but I can't get them quite snugged up. So I'm gonna have to go get one of the bicycle

tool kits and this is the front light for it. I was running them all night last night. They run on

AAAs and can, you know, I'm going to run the batteries down and I'm thinking about getting

those lithium-ion rechargeable batteries. I also got a big old chain lock for this thing.

I've probably had, oh, I don't know. The last bike that was stolen was this Roadmaster. I bought,

you know, I got a donation in Florida when I was homeless and I bought a Roadmaster

mountain bike. I was riding it all over. I went to Cocoa Beach and back to Titusville and all

over the place and I can't remember where I was. I think I was in a town called Taylorville,

something like that, and just sleeping on a bench. I had the bike locked to a bike rack,

but I was just using one of those little, they have this really cheap bike lock. I think I got

it at Dollar General or something for a dollar. When I woke up a few hours later, the bike had

just vanished. I walked over to the police department and filed a full police report

saying the bike was stolen, but now I'm extremely cautious about it. I got this gigantic

chain for it. You know, this chain is so strong. I don't know what the strength of it is. I wish

I could pull the strap up for you to show you, but it is so strong that it would take a little

more time to cut through that. I don't know, you know, I'm trying to figure out which bike paths

to take where other bicycles are that I don't run into the risk of this one getting stolen.

If it's sitting with a lot of other bikes, it's probably okay because one of the downsides is,

you know, when you have a bicycle, you have to almost look after the thing when you're out.

So, you know, I always keep it in sight. Last night when I locked it, I locked it at the opera

house where security was because they had a bike rack there and then walked over to Whataburger to

get a meal. There were a bunch of other bikes locked there with a security guard right there.

So, it seemed like it shouldn't get stolen and that was with the gigantic bike lock on it. But

the other issue is they can walk away with other stuff like the seat. The seat has a quick release

on it and I was thinking about getting one of those brackets that you bolt on. So, it's much

more difficult to pull the seat off and the rear tire potentially. I'm locking the front tire,

but the rear tire potentially you can you can take off. So, I'm trying to keep it under camera

wherever I park it. But that's, you know, that's a pain of bicycle ownership and I'm gonna keep

learning. I'm trying to talk to people and see what the best bike paths are. But when I convert

this to an e-bike, you know, it's going to be that much more difficult to lock up. Like I'll have to

walk it in the store with me and and have it like chained to my legs so it doesn't disappear.

The e-bike kits, you know, I haven't gotten into them too much. But I saw there were a bunch, you

know, I saw a few other e-bikes rolling around both downtown and on the sidewalk. Just people

riding e-bikes around. So, it looks like a good thing to get into and looks like a lot of fun too.

So, I'm gonna keep researching online e-bike kits and how to install them

and go from there. Anyway, thank you!

So I'm out in front of the Opera House looking for places to get footage of,

and I'm out in the morning crowd, which is a little more populated and different than the

evening crowd or the night crowd, you know, where I usually am. I still, you know, I don't think...

I slept till like 8 p.m. yesterday, so my sleep cycle is still completely backwards, but I was

wide awake enough to get on the bus and go down to the Opera House. I'm just looking for openings

as they come along, so I went out and got Whataburger. They said the booking or whatever

opens at 9. I don't know if there's going to be a section of it that opens to the public.

I was going to get footage and see what's available. It's a big, you know, music spot,

and TikTok is a big music brand, so I thought if I just walked up there and said, you know,

I have this many followers and I'm looking for footage to put on TikTok, if they would let me

through or find a place for me to get some footage. It just, you know, it would just come

down to advertising for the opera centers, all that they would get out of it, but I would get

more footage and more content to put on this page. I don't know if it's gonna work. There's probably

a better approach to this than the one I'm taking. The one I'm taking now is just kind of being nearby

and talking to people and seeing what comes through, so I'm gonna wait another hour or two

and then go bother people up there and see if anyone feels like talking. But right now,

there's a huge fitness and outdoor fitness kind of exercise going on. So, because I started with

this bicycle thing, you know, I don't know what all the bicycle events are that go on in Austin,

but there's got to be quite a few. I'm sitting at the park now, so I haven't seen many other bikes

out yet, but they got to be around. Because I'm probably going to try to convert this thing to

an e-bike, it's going to put it in a different category than the straight fitness cycling

one. Plus, I don't think I'm getting enough calories in yet to start a fitness routine.

You know, I'm still thinking in how many calories I'm ingesting, not how to stay in perfect shape.

Once I get, you know, more calories in my diet, then I'll start working on what a good fitness

routine would be. But as it sits now, you know, I'm just kind of parading myself and my bike around

to see who's chatty and what we can get out of this whole thing. I've been telling my story

to people and I'm getting, you know, making a little headway, but not as much as I would hope.

So, I'm getting there. I'm going to, you know, kind of roll around downtown for the morning and

see if anything pops up. So, anyway, thank you.

So I'm out on Veterans Day and they have a pretty good sized parade lined up.

The guy was telling me that before COVID, this thing was much bigger.

Now, after COVID, you know, the parade has shrunk down considerably,

which is a shame because, you know, a Veterans Day parade is a big deal.

But I was just corrected.

I thought this truck was identified as a deuce and a half.

It is not. It is actually a five ton.

But being from Nevada, you know, I don't know about the five ton

because I may have seen five tons out there and not known the difference.

But being from Nevada, you know, the deuce and a half was the big deal of trucks

to go out in the desert because they could always do go farther and haul more

than anything else out there.

So it was always the big deal.

And it was pretty nice seeing one out here in Texas,

although it is after being corrected, not a deuce and a half.

It is a five ton, which is slightly bigger

than the standard deuce and a half.

The guy who owns it said his son actually has a deuce and a half,

but and was going to come down here for Veterans Day, but had to work.

It's a shame.

You know, the more of these you see rolling around, the better.

They have always been one of my favorites.

I've seen them online.

Government liquidation, you know, sales, stuff like that,

that we're pretty cheap

and you can do all sorts of modifications to them.

You can lift them.

You can turn them into four by fours.

They have this little boxer one, I think.

I can't remember, but it's just a really good platform.

It has this diesel engine in it that'll run on anything.

I think they'll run on diesel, kerosene,

some other weird,

you know, all sorts of variations of that.

So it's a really interesting platform for, you know, all sorts.

It can do river crossings.

It's a it's an interesting truck.

So anyway, thank you and happy Veterans Day.

As I make it to the Veterans Day parade, it's going on right behind me.

I recorded 10 minutes of just watching the parade go by.

But I decided to get my blurb on the thing.

It's going for quite a ways.

They're going from the bridge to the capitol.

I don't know what they're going to.

Quite a few cars.

It's a parade.

It was fun to watch. Glad I came down for it.

Happy to live in this country.

I hope things keep going well.

I'm getting more and more stable and higher and cleaning everything up.

I'm just climbing up through society, I guess.

Mostly while sitting in that hotel room.

I'm learning camera work and everything to do with it.

I'm going to keep working on it.

Thank you.

When I was in Vegas, I had a C5 Corvette and it was a lot of fun. C5 Z06, 2003.

And they're having a parade of Corvettes at the Veterans Day

Fair. So I decided to get a short clip of them. The C8 is now like a rear engine. It's

completely different from the old ones. You know, that's a C6.

It's the equivalent of a C06, but it's a Grand Sport, so it's an automatic C06. Another C8.

C6. I think that's a C3.

And C7 behind it, the blue one. I had a lot of fun in that Corvette. I think I owned it for two years,

put about 20,000 miles on it. It was pristine, never got in an accident, never caused any issues

to the car, but it did blow an engine, had all sorts of electrical issues. I was driving safely

and comfortably and the engine just blew on the thing. The valve springs broke in the engine and

caused the valves to drop into the cylinder, which destroyed the engine. So it was covered

under warranty, but it was a C5 like those two right there. It was just the hard top Z06 instead

of those, which is a convertible and a T-top or Targa top, I guess. But that was the fastest car

I've ever owned. I had drag radials on the rear of it that Nitto 555Rs on all four corners. So you

had to warm them up but they got so much traction that it would just go like no other. And that was

with only 420 horsepower or something. I can't remember what the quarter miles were. I think

I think people got it in 12s, potentially 11s, but I don't know. I was like low 14s,

high 13s maybe. I wasn't the best driver. I would take it out to Las Vegas Motor Speedway

and race there once in a while, but I didn't drag race enough. And you know, I was always concerned

about the poor transmission. It was hard like pushing it to the absolute edge, but it was a

lot of fun to cruise around in. And for like passing, it was absurd because there's a lot

of two lane highways in Nevada. And passing like 40 mile an hour trucks on the State Route 95,

um, you would have so much horsepower to go by them. It was absurd. So it was a lot of fun. Great

for cruising down the Vegas Strip, which is what I mostly used it for. And uh, it was mostly

Garage Queen. I think, you know, I had one guy inspect it right before I sold it and the clutch

fluid was dark. So it had dark clutch fluid in it. But other than that, he said it looked great. So

uh, no scratches or anything. I'm still like hoping that gets my foot in the door in the

Corvette Club. It hasn't happened yet, but maybe if I keep talking about it, it will. Anyway, thank you.

I've been going through e-bike conversion kits. I bought a bicycle from Walmart for like,

I think it was $260 and I got lights and a lock for it. But there's e-bike conversion kits that

it's about $300 for the motor and all the wiring and then another $200 for a battery.

And I was going through the different wattages, you know, watt hours and range

available and, you know, being able to buy multiple batteries. People are saying you're

getting about 30 miles out of a 20 amp hour battery. So that's pretty good. I was looking

at all the much more expensive brands of bikes that come factory electric and they don't have

nearly as big of a battery, but they're claiming the same range. So I don't know what that's about,

but the limit is 750 watt rear hub motor on a conversion kit. So that's what I'm looking at.

I haven't put together yet, but it would be a fun project. I made some money on TikTok,

so that's what I'm using to put into the thing. Anyway, thank you.

So I'm really hemming and hawing about doing an e-bike conversion kit or just buying an e-bike

outright, which I avoided doing. I ended up getting that Ozark Trail. And the e-bike, you know,

there's all sorts of reservations I have with getting an e-bike.

One being locking the thing. You know, most everyone

takes their e-bikes in the store that they're going to rather than locking them outside.

And the regular bike I can just lock outside and walk around and not have to think about it

because it's not worth anything to begin with. So that's one benefit to the regular bike.

The other is the e-bike's considerably more dangerous because you're going 20, 28 miles an

hour versus, you know, whatever pedaling speed is. And the third, you know, I'm using this thing

to get exercise. With an e-bike, you're just kind of sitting there. So those are my three

reservations. I can convert the bike I have to an e-bike pretty easily. Other people have,

it converts right over and works pretty well. I can get multiple batteries for it

that I think they're like 30 mile range each. They're 20 amp hours whereas, you know, the

base ones are like, or the stock e-bike you buy are like 5 amp hours. So it's got considerably more

battery longevity in it. And I could buy multiple batteries for it as well.

You know, getting my range up to like 150 miles, which is really good. But, you know, I just don't,

I can kind of wheel around slowly on the bicycle as it is and be pretty comfortable.

So I'm probably sticking with it, you know, worrying about theft every second. Whereas,

if parts get ripped off of that thing, like I'm leaving a flashlight on the front of it.

If the flashlight gets stolen, it was a $10 flashlight, it's not the end of the world.

Whereas, if a battery gets stolen, you know, it's a $200 battery, that's a pretty big theft. So

I'm weighing my options, but I'm sticking with the regular bike at least for now

because it's just so easy to ride around and I get the right amount of exercise with it.

Um, so I don't get too pent up. You know, part of the reason, part of the problem I was having

is I couldn't sleep at night. Just getting too pent up and getting some exercise on a bicycle

really alleviates a lot of that. So, uh, I'm sticking with the regular bike for now. It's

working great. You know, I'm getting all the right tools and accessories for the thing. I'm still,

you know, I'm total spent thinking about like $350. That's with the full tool kit and, um,

like a water holder and, and I don't know, a tire repair kit, stuff like that. So it's staying way

cheap. Um, for a brand new bike, uh, $350 with all the accessories is way less than anything else.

It is the, the quintessential cheap Walmart bike that's very popular and does a really good job.

You know, it's, it's doing is done a really good job up to this point and I hope it continues.

So anyway, thank you.

So I've been going through the fungal infection, jock itch, ringworm, and I don't know if it's

even still there or not. I've been putting so much treatment on it, I haven't been paying

attention to like its progress, but I finally stopped a few days ago and there's like nothing

left of the thing. So that prescription did a really good job. I dumped hand sanitizer on

everything which was kind of my indicator because before, you know, any hand sanitizer whatsoever

would cause all kinds of awful burning. And I put hand sanitizer on everything and there was

no burning whatsoever. So it appears to be at least healed over. I don't know if there's any

infection still under the skin or anything, but it's healed over the surface, which that is the

first time that has happened in 20 years. So it's, you know, 23 years even. It's quite a while. So

that is a big accomplishment. My face, you know, as you can see, it's still chewed up. It's old

acne that I squeezed too many times and it's making its way to the surface and is clearing

out steadily. I've brought down how many showers I'm taking way down to, I think now I'm down to

almost one a day just to get everything the way it should be. I know if you over scrub,

you can cause all your natural oils to, you know, you just wash them all away and then your skin

doesn't heal correctly. So hopefully my face will clear up soon. I'm riding this bike all over town

having a ball. I'll keep you all updated. Anyway, thank you.

So I was going through clips online and all sorts of like ancient mythology,

the Egyptian pyramids, the Mayan pyramids, and what they have to do with each other.

I, you know, like the human desire to go to the moon has existed probably since Egypt. Probably

10,000 years ago they were trying to build a structure to go to the moon, which I am completely

against. It seems like a bad idea from the start. You know, the earth operates with a gravity system

that keeps the climate in check and the moon helps with that climate. So the gravity of the moon is

affecting the earth's climate. And if you start putting a bunch of stuff up there,

a bunch of people, structures, whatever, on the moon, then, you know, it disrupts all that. It

disrupts the earth's climate because the moon has then shifted orbit because you've changed the

gravity and the direction the moon is traveling in. So in my opinion, avoid the moon at all costs.

Have nothing to do with it. This appears to be a discussion that has existed since Egypt. It looks

like Egypt built the pyramids solely because a bunch of people were trying to go to the moon,

which was probably a bad idea in the first place. And the Mayans were probably trying to do the

same thing, you know, and you know, just don't go there because you can affect, you can negatively

impact the entire earth by disrupting its climate or by disrupting the moon's orbit in any way

will negatively impact earth's climate. I've said this before, you know, if the moon's closer,

the earth gets warmer. If the moon's farther, the earth gets colder. And if you start piling a bunch

of people up there, you're going to have that thing adjust and it's going to cause, you know,

all sorts of climate disruptions on earth. So that's at least my theory. You know, it,

I don't know how far it gets, but it looks like it's been a problem for a long time

that people have been trying to go to the moon and something has been blocking them from going

to the moon. So that's something appears to be the negative impact that would happen to earth

if you go there. And I've been going through these stranded astronauts, you know, I lived,

I was homeless in, in Florida, in central Florida, right next to Kennedy Space Center.

And I lived in a tent in the jungle and it just gave me a lot of time to think about,

you know, all of this stuff like going to space and, and what's a waste of resources and what's

not. And if you get to space, what's a good place to go? Like, where do you go? Once you get there,

you build a space station, you sit in low earth orbit. You go to Mars, you build a colony there.

But the problem is the second you let the general masses go to space, they just start

like tearing down everything. So, you know, before going up there, you should understand

like landing stuff on the moon. How bad is that? How big of a negative impact is that going to be

on earth? Having, you know, that thing shift course all over the place with all these rockets

flying around it. So in my opinion, I'm sticking to don't go to the moon whatsoever. I don't know

if these astronauts that are stranded in the International Space Station and have been for

quite some time, we're like trying for a moon project and then that's like the thing going off

causing them to, or causing the block. You know, it seems like there's a block going off where you

just shouldn't go at the moon in the first place. I don't know if they got right into that,

but as for me, how I got out of being stranded in Florida was I started using TikTok. I just

upload videos on TikTok, which is a Chinese program, or at least was. I think it still is a

Chinese program. I started uploading videos on TikTok and having that cooperation with China

seemed to like boost me up, you know, being able to negotiate and communicate with China

in a peaceful way seemed to boost me up in the United States. So that's what pulled me out of

of being homeless in Central Florida to having a hotel room in Austin, which has held up to

this point and I hope it continues. Anyway, thank you.

So I'm having trouble getting on the bus Friday and Saturday nights. I don't know if it's just

like too hot. Like too many people fighting with each other or what. So I'm kind of stuck

at the hotel room. I was going to go down to the park just outside the opera and kind of roll around

on the bicycle there and see what was going on. But I'm stuck at the hotel room. I'm not brave

in that bus just to go down there. So I'm gonna stay in tonight. I slept again during the day

and so now I'll probably be awake at night. But I can sit around or roll around on the bike

around here and see if any footage comes up and see what clips to make. You know I'm going through

TikTok versus Instagram and I think I just like TikTok more. I'm putting more into TikTok. I also

think TikTok likes me more because I have a lot more followers on here and the Instagram one like

isn't really doing anything. Plus TikTok is more music focused which at least was where my aptitudes

were where my aptitude was. I don't know what Instagram's premise is. I think it's just

photography and like modeling which I don't know as well. But I could probably use you know

I could use the skill set from it to better this channel for one thing. So anyway thank you.

I went out and got a guitar at Guitar Center with the money I made last month. I still have

quite a bit left, you know. I took a little break from TikTok just because, you know,

I finally got some money in and just needed a break from it. So, stop uploading videos, but

I'm getting back into music. Before, I played the bass clarinet, which is an orchestra instrument,

and it's not the easiest thing to make money with. It's not the simplest instrument. It's

hard to find a place for the thing. The whole reason I got it in the first place is because

it was available. You know, I was in Winnemucca, Nevada, and there were very few instruments to

choose from. I was going to go with the saxophone, but everyone was playing the saxophone.

So, I ended up getting a bass clarinet instead, and then it just didn't fit in anywhere. You know,

it was very difficult to find an orchestra that wanted a bass clarinet. So, I played a guitar,

like, very little when I was younger, but this time, you know, I can actually teach myself how

to play it, and it is a moneymaker. You know, I can just park myself anywhere, at the park,

on the street corner, wherever, and play the guitar and probably get donations in.

So, it's good for that reason. I got this thing half-priced because it has a ding on the back of

it that apparently crashed at Guitar Center and dinged up the back. I put a bunch of wood glue

on it, sanded it down. It seems to be okay. It's all in tune, so we tuned it at the store and

got everything working. I haven't gotten a case for it yet. I don't know if I'm going to get one

or not. The cases are 20 bucks, and it looks pretty cool riding the bike around with a guitar

on my back, but the problem is, it's really, like, dangerous for both me and the guitar,

because the whole thing is just unstable. So, I just tried to ride down to the park

with the guitar on my back and ended up turning back around. It doesn't help that it's 45 degrees

outside, so it wasn't the best morning to go out, but I wanted to try the thing out to see if it

works, to see if I can pull it off. So, I'm back to the drawing board on how to transport this

safely on the bus. The biggest difficulty is riding the bicycle to the bus and then getting

on the bus with a guitar without a case on it. So, I'm going to keep figuring out the best way

to make money with this thing and try to get my foot in the door back in music,

where I've been before many times. So, anyway, thank you!

So like I said, I got a good amount of money in last month from TikTok and I only bought,

you know, a $300 bike and a $300 guitar. So that's all I really bought out of that money.

So I still have like a lot of cash sitting here and I'm trying to be as frugal as possible with it

to make it last because I don't know, you know, I'm getting like $400 from TikTok this month,

which isn't very much. I think I have like $1,300 here and I don't know, you know,

I'm trying to turn this money into more money. That's why I bought the guitar because it's

pretty easy to just sit anywhere and get donations because I'm using a bicycle as transportation.

Getting enough money in for a car would be ideal, but it hasn't happened yet. So I'm learning the

guitar as we speak. I'm doing more repair to the thing. Like I said, the back of it

had a ding when I bought it and it was like a $600 guitar that they marked down to like $230.

And it had this big old ding on the back of it that dented in. It's dented and there's

all sorts of cracks. So I'm on my third day of wood glue getting this thing to its full potential.

But it sounds incredible. Like just barely hitting the notes on it, it sounds like a professional

guitar. You know, a very clear, crisp, acoustic guitar. So I am unbelievably happy with the

purchase. I'm going to have to learn a few songs on it and go from there because I don't have much

guitar experience. But it's the easiest way to earn a living from the position I'm in is just

play guitar. So that's what I'm working on. Anyway, thank you.

So I've been going to the park, getting a lot of exercise and just enjoying it. Austin downtown has

like the best park along the river. So I've been going down there. It's day three of rain here

and like 40-45 degrees outside. So it's cold but you know in Alaska and Canada

I was going down to 20 below outdoors and mostly okay. You know it wasn't the most comfortable

situation but was pulling through in 20 below sleeping in a truck. So 40-45 isn't very cold.

I was going to go down to the park but I'm just not motivated enough to go down there

because there's not going to be enough people and it's just kind of dreary and rainy. But as for

the temperature, you know it's not that cold at 45-50. All these temperatures are pretty warm.

I know everyone in Austin is used to the warm weather and you know even when it drops below

50 degrees think they're going to get sick and have all these problems when I don't think so.

You know you can go down with a couple layers of clothes, a couple pairs of pants, a couple sweatshirts,

jackets, gloves and hats. You can go down to 20-30 below and be comfortable.

So you know 45-50 that's like just jacket weather. So anyway, thank you.

So, as I said before, I haven't had a date in eight years, I think. And the last one was

that I actually made it the whole way with, was a Latin woman in Boise, Idaho. And she was also

bisexual, and I don't know what I got myself webbed into with that. I broke up with her because

she was involved in illicit activities. And I was trying to dig myself out of crime.

This is the other reason. I was trying to dig myself out of any criminal involvement whatsoever,

which my parents were very webbed in the casinos and all sorts of shady behavior. So I was trying

to explain all of that and get all of that clear, which caused everything to bog down.

I was extremely successful with women until I tried to clean up anything criminal whatsoever.

So, tax evasion, association, fraud. There were all sorts of weird properties that

my parents owned in Nevada that I had to go around and sell off one by one.

And that also caused me a bog down. And I had to travel all over the place,

explaining what my parents were doing all over the country. So the lower 48, all over Alaska,

explaining my side of the story. And I went bankrupt in this process.

So while trying to get everything clear, I went bankrupt

explaining what got me in that situation and why I wasn't personally involved in any crime,

but I had to dig myself out of it. So that really hurt my chances of dating because everything was

so unstable. I had to travel around constantly. I had to sell a bunch of properties. And I had

to explain where money was from that I had no real explanation of how it was received.

So this flagged every radar, caused me to really get bogged down getting it resolved.

Secondly, I had this jock itch for 20 years and it got really bad around that time.

And I think I have it clear now, although there's no way to be sure. There's one little

spot on my leg. I did a lot of treatment to it. So I don't know if it's there or not,

but it's considerably better than it was. So that was bogging me down too.

Third, I was really successful with women in Las Vegas and Arizona and Idaho and Alaska and Oregon

and California. So I had girlfriends all over the place during my 20s and

none of them were lasting at all. So I probably went on dates with like 200 women and then got

somewhere with a hundred of them and then went all the way with about 30 of them. So it's a lot

of girlfriends. I stopped when I was like 34. So right at the Latin woman, I stopped completely

because her mechanism was completely opposite to everything I had known.

Hers was all closer to family and really stationary, being really stationary and stable.

Whereas what I was from was my dad flying around all over the place,

everything moving constantly, no one knew what you were doing, no connection with any sort of

family members whatsoever. So this was the exact polarized opposite. I took on two polarized

opposites simultaneously. One being I was trying to resolve all crime and explain all crime and pay

for any crime that was committed. And secondly, I was trying to remain completely stationary

without any flying around, without any driving around, without any running in circles.

So that's what really, you know, when you reverse the whole thing, you reverse like everything you

are and then you have to create a completely new circle of friends in order to to climb up again.

So that's what got in the way. And I should, you know, I dated a woman in Omaha, Nebraska,

who was a psychiatrist maybe six years ago. So I think I went on one date with her

after the whole mess in Boise. But I had to get out of Boise. I am done with it.

The only reason I was there in the first place was to sell off a property we had in Winnemucca

and that was the closest I could get to sell the thing and get out of any sort of criminal

involvement in Nevada. So that really bogged me down. I'm trying, you know, part of it was

the women I was dating, you know, I wasn't like trying to get quality. I was going for

quantity over quality and none of the relationships were lasting more than a week or two.

And I was never that enthusiastic, you know, maybe I could have been more enthusiastic about them,

but I was never that enthusiastic about dating them in the first place. They were just available

and, you know, whoever was available, you know, you have a few beers going online dating, whoever's

available, that's just who you end up with. I tried to reverse this thing. This is the other

bog down. I tried to reverse this thing to where, you know, I date a quality woman and it leads to

marriage and then I have a long stable marriage instead of this like one week relationship thing

that is mostly a waste of time. So, you know, having to reverse the whole thing where

everything I was involved with had good schools and good communities and I wasn't, you know,

I wasn't going to raise kids in a place that was too criminally involved. So that's really

what caused everything to go to a standstill. Now I have most everything clear now. All,

you know, all crimes committed, everything explained. I got through all the motion that

was driving me around everywhere and I got my face mostly clear. The other thing is my face

has been chewed up for three or four years now exactly like this and once I get all this clear,

you know, I'll just be more attractive and more, you know, more pleasing to look at. So

that's what caused my eight-year hiatus or six-year hiatus, however you want to. I didn't

go the whole way with the woman in Omaha, but did go on a date with her. So anyway, thank you.

So, as I said before, I'm learning how to play the guitar. You know, I just got this thing

a week ago. I put, you know, I finally got this back end glued and painted over, so it mostly

blends in. I was going to sand the glue down, but it's so much sanding that I'm doing more damage

to the thing. Plus, it's a lot tougher this way having this much glue on it, so I'm just sticking

with the glue, and it doesn't have to be perfect anyway. It was half price because of the damage,

but it sounds good. Unfortunately, I'm not the best guitar player yet. You know, I'm at the

musical or guitar playing ability of a door chime. You know, I can do like three little notes,

just stuff like that, and that's where I'm at. You know, I can slide the fingers around,

but I haven't even started on how to play this thing correctly. It sounds incredible though.

It is such a good sounding guitar. I have never played a guitar this nice before,

and as I've shown, you know, I've only probably played, you know, actually played around on

four other guitars in the past, and one of those was a bass guitar, so this is the first like

actually nice acoustic I've ever used, and it does have a plug-in for an amplifier on the back

and has the knobs for bass treble balance, but I, uh, uh, brilliant, sorry. Anyway, I haven't

plugged it in yet or even tried. I was thinking about plugging it into the cell phone and then

using the headphones from the cell phone to get a more amplified sound out of it,

but it sounds pretty good just like this, and it's given me something to do,

um, something to learn that can make money. Uh, once I get the notes down, you know, it's just

getting my fingers trained how to push these chords correctly is, uh,

is time consuming as well, so, you know, I'm learning the thing. Like I said before, the only

instrument I ever played, um, in any sort of band was the clarinet, and it was a bass clarinet,

which is really rare. Uh, it's like an alto sax, only no one uses it, so I gave up entirely on the

thing. Um, uh, acoustic guitar is simple and easy, and people can understand it. There's a lot of

songs written, uh, specifically for acoustic guitars, so there, there's a million uses for

the thing. Plus, I just like the sound of an acoustic guitar. You know, you gotta like the

sound of what, what instrument you're playing, so I like the sound of this thing. I'm gonna keep

working at it, uh, to see how far I can teach myself. As for now, I'm just like playing around

with little melodies, um, what I can come up with without any sort of, uh, training or experience,

um, to, uh, to see what sounds I can make that aren't in, in the conventional quote-unquote box

of music. So anyway, thank you!

So like always, I couldn't cool off in the hotel room, and then right when I took my bike out to

cross the street, you know, like six cars piled into me. So that just made me more upset. So

anyway, I came downtown to this bike path, which has got to be the best bike path I've ever been.

I don't know if anything can touch this bike path. This is a bridge of the thing.

It has like three or four of these. You can see it this way. There's the skyline,

Austin, Texas skyline. And if you turn around this way, there's a whole another mile of bridge.

So it's right over the river and really nice. The skyline looks incredible. Like this is one

of the prettiest little cities I think I've ever been to. I don't think I've been to a prettier

little city than this one. It's not the biggest, you know, like New York and Manhattan are bigger,

but it is a really nice place to be. And because I'm from Winnemucca, that's almost complementary

that the Austin mechanism and the Winnemucca mechanism are really similar. So I can kind of

fall into the Winnemucca niche here, despite it being Texas, not Nevada. And you know, Nevada has

different laws than Texas, like gambling is legal. And so you can play cards at the casino and stuff

like that. Whereas in Texas, you know, I don't know what the law is on specifically poker and

Texas Hold'em and stuff like that. I think you can have like parties at your house and then deal

poker, but you can't have a rake running on the table. A rake is where the house takes a cut of

the pot every hand. And then, you know, that's to keep the thing going. I think in Texas,

you can have a poker table going, but you can't, you know, you can't

turn a profit with it. So you can just play straight cards and have the pot untouched every

hand. So I've been eyeing that, you know, that would be a good little social gathering. I'm not

the best at poker. I used to play a very simple strategy of just wait till I have good cards and

then bet heavy. And you know, I would get, I think a few times I got to the final table at a few poker

tournaments, but I never won. You know, I'd always get like fourth place or something, but this was

out of a couple hundred people. So it got me that far with that simple little strategy. You know,

you don't even have to worry about bluffing or any of the more complicated poker strategies.

You just wait for good cards and then bet. And I got a pretty good winning average just out of that.

So anyway, thank you.

So I made my way to the Driscoll, which is in downtown Austin, and it's an old hotel.

I don't know, probably early 1900s. There's a lot of hotels like this in Nevada. If you

go outside of Las Vegas, Las Vegas doesn't have very many, but the rest of Nevada has

hotels like this, and they are roughly the same age. The Hotel Nevada in Ely and the

Mizpah in Tonopah are both like really old hotels that are based on this kind of design.

This western, you know, saloon kind of platform. Now the ones in Nevada have gambling and all

sorts of other night activities, whereas I don't think this one does, but it does have

cool old historical artifacts like this old vault. I guess they would keep the valuables

in. And you can see all the bricks and concrete of the thing from when it was built. You know,

I think it was the Mizpah in Tonopah. There's an old story of one of these vaults that got

broken into because the thieves broke in through the floor. You can see how it's bricked,

and they have a gigantic door on it that locks really heavily, but apparently the floor wasn't

very secure, so they came in and dug a tunnel underneath the building and then up through

the floor and was able to take everything out of the vault. And I think it was the Mizpah. It

might have been the Goldfield Hotel. That was another one in central Nevada. It closed down,

too, but the Mizpah is still going. It was one of those that got broken into and they got away

with everything. So, you know, from a security standpoint, not looking at how secure the floor

is was a blunder on their part. But anyway, going back to this Driscoll, this thing is incredible

how good of shape it's in. I wish I could go through the rest of the hotel. They have a

private event upstairs, and the bar is completely packed. So I shouldn't film up there, but I was

able to get a short clip of the lobby here. So anyway, thank you.

So I've been riding the bike around the park and I made my way to the spot called Barton Springs.

It is a big outdoor swimming area that I've never been to before. I didn't even know it was here.

It was free to get in so I decided to walk by and upload a short clip of the thing.

I do not have swimming trunks. I just have black jeans on so I will not be swimming today.

I don't even own a pair of swimming trunks. I am probably going to go buy them because I've

been riding that bike with black jeans on and they're not the loosest fitting ones so it is the

least comfortable experience. But I'm probably going to go get swimming trunks later today and

then hope this is free when I come back because I'll hop in the water here. It looks pretty fun

for mid-December. I'm happy I live in Austin, Texas because I have lived in Alaska and traveled

through Canada and all sorts. You know parts of Nevada would get 39 degrees below zero. It was

that cold. So being down in Austin where it's nice and warm is wonderful because like for instance

Wasilla, Alaska it would be like 20 below for the low and 19 below for the high for like three

months. That was the temperature all the time. So it was so cold you couldn't go outside and it was

always a blizzard so I left up there. That's probably the temperature it is there right now.

Whereas Austin you know I think we're at like 77 degrees and the sun's coming out so it feels even

warmer than 77. So I'm really happy to be here. I plan to make this last as long as possible.

Anyway, thank you.

So, uh, that jock itch came back, uh, with a vengeance. Um, I was using the shower shampoo

and spray and cream and then prescription cream. Um, and, uh, you know, thought it was gone

completely. So I switched the prescription, only used the first tube of the dose because it looked

like it was staining my skin like brown and it, it, it looked really bad. So I stopped using it

because it looked like the infection was gone. But, uh, uh, then, you know, a few weeks later,

it was right back again. So I don't know, you know, I can't see a physician at all.

It's impossible. I don't know. I'm going to the park a lot to try to socialize as much as possible.

I don't need, if I need a voucher or what, um, I'm in all these weird subterranean gears.

Like for instance, I bought a pair of swimming trunks, uh, because the Barton Springs, um,

swimming season, you know, in the winter, it's free to go there. And because I spend time in Alaska,

uh, you know, I have more tolerance to cold weather, although I don't have the best tolerance

to cold water. Um, so I was just eyeing it to see if I could swim in there and that creates

peace of mind for everyone else. If they see me swim in there and not get sick, then they'll,

they'll feel better about not getting sick in cold weather, cold water. Um, but, uh, as for

getting sick, you know, this jock itch, there's no way to get rid of it apparently from this position.

Uh, so I'm stuck in this position, um, until there, there's a path available, which hasn't

happened yet. I, uh, uh, going back to the swimming trunks, I bought them without trying them on

because I had a backpack on, uh, and I didn't want to go into the changing room with the backpack.

I didn't want to leave the backpack outside the changing room. So I, I went home, uh, with the

swimming trunks, tried them on when I got back and the rope is tied in a very weird way to where

it's really difficult to tie them off tightly. You know, they always stay kind of loose no matter how

you tighten them or how you tie it off. So I was going to return them, but apparently I guess because

I tried them on or, uh, left the store without trying them on, I can't return them. Uh, you know,

you're supposed to try them on before leaving the store. Uh, but because I had that backpack,

I couldn't try them on before leaving the store. And then when I got home and tried them on,

they didn't work and now I can't return them. So I'm stuck with them. This is, this is the type

of situation I'd find myself in, in this gear. Uh, so that's what I'm going through now. I'm,

I'm working on them to try to make them work because they're what I got. And I have to be

thankful for what I have, which is a backpack, a bicycle and an acoustic guitar and the cell phone.

So those are all my belongings, but I'm appreciative for those four things.

At least they didn't get stolen like everything else I fucking owned. Anyway, thank you.

So I'm still searching for sources of income. Like I said, I bought an acoustic guitar

and don't have much skill on the thing other than like, you know, thumbing around on it.

I don't have much acoustic guitar training or anything. So I was thinking about trying to earn

enough for guitar lessons to actually be able to play the thing and being well endowed, as I've

said before. You know, there's only certain places I can go. You know, there's been a lot of

discussion about it. I ended up making an adult site account and I just can't go the whole way

with it. It's like I'm limited. So I'm stuck once again. And I don't know, you know, maybe there's

certain places, nothing has signs on it to know what you're supposed to do, how to handle

situations or, you know, especially in this, in the exact situation I'm in of being

in an industry no one wants to talk about, but everyone, everyone pays for. So I'm slowly

making my way in that direction. But, you know, there's no like signs of which way to go

or how to, how to accomplish it. And I'm completely 100% straight,

which is the other thing, you know, I don't, I don't want to do anything with any guys.

So I'm avoiding all of that as, as much as possible, you know, nothing against them,

but I'm completely straight. So, you know, I don't want to do anything with any guys, but

that said, you know, my master plan is get a little experience in the

dolled industry because I'm well endowed anyway. That's pretty much the direction I have to go in,

then earn enough for guitar lessons, learn the guitar, and then be able to play music with that

in my, in my resume, with entertainer, quote unquote, in my resume, that will just boost

any sort of musical career I choose. So it's a good idea to just throw that thing in there anyway,

to have it because they'll just make more money down the road.

If I am able to get successful in music in any way, which I have been before, like I said,

but this was when I was like 10 years old. So now 42, you know, I have to re go through everything

and I was playing a different instrument. You know, I wish I picked up the guitar when I was a kid,

but I don't think I had access to one to be able to learn it. The only thing I had access to was

that bass clarinet. So that's what I'm going through. Once again, I can't sleep, you know,

tried, was going to go down to the park and sit and watch the skyline and just kind of

walk and ride the bicycle around the park. But I have to take the bus the whole way down there

and it's a good hour bus ride. And in the middle of the night, it's always kind of sketchy.

And I was getting spooked off the bus as it is. So, you know, having to ride at night

and it looks like it's going to start raining at 3 a.m. So that kind of ruined my plans of

going down there. And I'm stuck to back on the side of the road, giving explanations

as to what I'm doing. So anyway, thank you.

So I spent all day riding the bike around. You know, I scheduled an appointment to get

an STD test, which still hasn't happened. Now this one's going to cost $220, but I get

to see a physician and have this jock itch looked at, because it's still there. So I'm

going to go down there. It's not until next Thursday. I had to make the appointment next

Thursday. That's the soonest I can get one. And I went to the grocery store and got sushi

and sat around, rode the bike back. I think it was like six miles round trip. So I'm putting

really, I'm putting a lot of miles on the bicycle, but it's still holding. One thing

I noticed is it doesn't have the rubber washers or inserts or whatever they are along the

pedals. And when you ride on gravel, dirt gets in the like pedal axle and causes it

to start grinding. So I'm not sure if you can buy those somewhere. I'm going to go to

the bicycle store tomorrow, see if you can buy those because it would block the gravel

from getting in there and cause the bike to stop grinding. Because I already started grinding

a little bit and it looks like that's where it's coming from. So that's what, it's my

main form of transportation. I'm just using it to get around like completely now. I was

using the bus a little bit, but once again, you know, I can't sleep. So I'm stuck awake

at night. I slept, I went to sleep at like seven and then woke up at nine or eight and

then I couldn't get back to sleep again. So sat on YouTube, looking at guitar lessons

and various, you know, other, other sources of income that, that may or may not make money.

So I'm just trying to earn a living, you know, any way I possibly can. And, and that's what's

got me standing out here on the side of the road again, because this is the best spot

to film a video. It's just where people stand outside and beg with cardboard and, and, and

along the road from cars. And it turns out, you know, you can use the same system on a

cell phone and just upload a video on the cell phone and get the same result, which

is what I've done. I'll, you know, I would teach other people how to do this. It's not,

you make an account on TikTok and then stand out on the side of the road and just kind

of tell your life story and accept donations. Now, as for me right now, you know, I had

a really good month on this thing and, uh, I'm still going, you know, I got maybe 4,500,

$5,000 in a month ago. And I think I still have, uh, maybe 3,000 of it, you know, quite

a bit. And I bought food, I bought a bicycle, I bought a, uh, acoustic guitar, I bought

some clothes. Uh, I don't know what else. So it, uh, it's still going, you know, I still

have plenty sitting there. So I don't need money per se, but now I need all this other

stuff, like, fixed. Like, I don't know how to play the acoustic guitar that well. Um,

I am well endowed, so I don't know what the most cash to get out of that is. I can only

go into certain social circles. So, uh, uh, I'm, I, you know, I got everything working

on, uh, the adult entertainment thing. But, you know, I'm just a little, yeah, a little

nervous about it. So I have to like, get more comfortable, um, which I'm working towards.

And, uh, I should have a, uh, uh, STD worries resolved in, uh, when I got that appointment

on Thursday. And hopefully they'll be able to completely clear out this jock itch rig

worm thing. So I never have to worry about it again. Anyway, thank you.

So I'm at the park once again and my sleep cycle is exactly reversed. So I end up sleeping all day

and then being awake all night. And it's cold, you know, it's a cold night but I have the park

all to myself which is pretty nice because I can go through kind of the training regimen

of the park because there's a lot of people in incredibly good shape that use this bike path I'm

on. So when it's busy, you know, I feel like, you know, I might be encroaching on other people's

space and stuff like that. But when it's quiet it's really good because I can go through like

the process of the thing without anyone being here. The downside is it's cold and, you know,

you don't get to people watch as much which is always fun. So that's the catch to it. I'm going

to be out here as long as I can put up with the cold. Once again, you know, this cold is,

it's strange, you know, when you're in different areas what classifies as cold is different. So

when you're in Alaska and it's 20 below you have multiple layers of clothing on you're still warm.

When you're in Austin and it's 50 degrees outside you have one layer of clothing on

and you're barely staying warm. So it's kind of a weird situation that, you know, you're just not,

because it's not cold here very often, the whole system doesn't involve cold weather clothing,

which is all that really seems to make the difference. You know, 20 below, I remember being

in 20 below weather and I had so many layers of clothes on, so many jackets, hats, hoods,

everything that, you know, I could be outside for an hour or two I think is about as long as I would

last. But stay warm for two hours and then have to bundle up to stay warm because I was sleeping

in a truck at the time on my way back from Alaska, the two, two and a half week drive

it takes to get back down from there. I was sleeping in my truck and I think I was turning

the thing off so I was just sleeping in the cold but I had blankets and everything covering me

and that was 20 below, legitimately morning, noon, and night 20 degrees below zero. So it's like 50

degrees here now in Austin and I feel cold. So it's pretty, pretty strange how much, you know,

thermal insulation helps with the cold. So anyway, thank you.

So one benefit to being cold in the middle of the night is I have free use over this outdoor

fitness area which is usually really crowded during the day. Like you have to stand out here

and wait in line to get to use it. So it's pretty nice at night because I can just sit out here

and do exercises. I'm not very good. Pull-ups are the worst.

See and I give out at about three. Here's another exercise. I've just been watching

other people do exercises and kind of reenacting what they're doing. This is another one.

And I don't know because I still can't afford the gym I use the outdoor fitness area instead

and it works especially at night. You know you can feel it in your upper body but

especially at night because there's no one to complain about you being out here.

Uh so you know I can sit out here for an hour and work out my angst whereas during the day you know

you got like five minutes with this thing before you have to move out of the way. So I can do push-ups

pretty well too. Trying to make a full clip of the thing. I'll bring it over to the push-up bar

but these are the exercises I can do. I am way over on legs. Like my legs I've been riding that

bicycle around. I've been walking. I've been going everywhere on my legs. So my legs are completely

over over what would be normal. But everything else is kind of weak. So as for push-ups I can

do a few of them just to show it. Uh there's five or so push-ups. I'm 42 so.

There's five push-ups and that pretty much winded me right there.

So uh that's what I'm doing with the night.

It's uh it's cold but you warm right up when you're doing these exercises. So anyway thank you.

So I made it downtown again.

I've been riding the bus to get from the hotel, which is very close to Austin North.

North Austin.

And so it's a good 10 miles to get down here.

It's pretty far to ride the bicycle the whole way.

And at one point I was looking at e-bikes, but I'm pretty much done with the idea.

The regular bicycle works so well that it keeps me in shape.

I get plenty of exercise, and it goes far enough.

Theoretically an e-bike would be able to make it the whole way without having to use the bus.

But I have to dodge traffic the entire way, which is a lot of work.

And that's work in its own way.

And also having to lock an e-bike is much more difficult than locking a regular bike.

I bought a gigantic chain lock for my little $250 Walmart bicycle.

Because it sits so low so much of the time that I had to put a gigantic lock on it.

While I hopefully climb up through society and get in better and better neighborhoods.

But as for now, I'm at the park at night and I have to lock the bike up.

And then I'll be sitting at Whataburger and I have to lock the bike up out front.

So that's the other reason I have a cheap bicycle.

I had a really good month on TikTok, like I said before.

And so I had enough for a much more expensive bicycle.

But I ended up getting the cheap one just because you don't have to worry so much about it.

I mean we were talking on the bus last night about me putting it on the front of the bus.

And being worried about it falling off.

And if it was a much more expensive bike, if it falls off of there, then I'm out all that money.

Whereas with this cheap one, $250, it's not as big of a concern.

Also, bang for the buck, the $250 bike, I'm not losing out on very much having the cheap bicycle.

There's one little rubber washer that goes over the pedal axle to keep dirt out of the center pedal axle shaft.

And without that washer on there, it's easier for dirt to get in there and it starts grinding.

So this cheap bike doesn't have that washer on it.

So dirt can get in the center shaft.

But that's about the only deficiency I've seen so far.

And it's been going great for what it is.

I'm kind of rolling around downtown Austin tonight.

I'm at the ice rink right now.

And just kind of rolling around looking for content and stories to tell.

Anyway, thank you.

So I made it to the Trail of Lights, which is a big Christmas celebration. A lot of Christmas

lights in Austin. And you can see the skyline in the background, so it's a really good display.

This is as close as I'm going to get because I kind of did a roll around of the whole thing,

and trying to get footage inside is more difficult. This is the best spot, in my opinion,

to see all the lights with the skyline in the background. This is the prettiest

angle. So I was going to go inside, but they want like $8, $10. I have a bicycle,

and so it's really complicated for me to get in there in the first place. I said I was a content

creator and have a few followers on this thing. So if they want advertising out of it,

this would be a way to get some. But it didn't work. I ended up just skipping it,

and I'll get footage from here. I only found this because I was riding on the bike path

and saw the lights from the side of the path. So I decided to come over and see what all the

blinking lights were because I don't know what it is about me. It might be being from Nevada,

but always getting drawn to anything with blinking lights seems to have been a curse of

mine since I was young. Las Vegas is all blinking lights, and I was drawn to that thing for 10 years.

And now there's blinking lights here at the Christmas thing, so I immediately gravitate

to it like a moth to a flame. So Merry Christmas, everyone, and thank you.

So I made it into the Trail of Lights and finding bicycle parking wasn't the easiest,

but I ended up locking it at the back of one of the vendors where I saw a few other bikes

and a few security things there. So, you know, not bicycle friendly, which if it were up

to me, I would make the city more bicycle friendly. Like, just across the board, more

bicycles everywhere. E-bikes, regular bikes, even gas bikes, you know, those old gas bikes.

You know, put them all in there, have locking, have places to lock them with security watching

and everything. Just because, you know, everyone's so pent up all the time getting a little exercise.

It sure helps me, you know, just rolling around on a bicycle, you know, you just calm down

from it. It's good exercise, you're outdoors, you know, all that stuff. So, anyway, back

to the Trail of Lights. This was the best spot I could find to get footage of. I'm walking

through the thing one or two times to see what it is. This is my first time at the Trail

of Lights. I guess I was here last year, but I didn't come down to it. So, it looks pretty

nice from what I've seen so far. I've only walked one quarter of the thing, so we'll

see how the whole thing goes. Anyway, thank you.

So I've made my way to the Trail of Lights again, and it is packed.

You know, I can't believe how many people are here.

There are thousands of people here.

The line starts all the way back there and goes the entire

way to the front.

So there are thousands of people, you know,

it's probably a good portion of the city here right now.

So it looks great with the skyline in the background and then all the Christmas

lights up front.

It looks really good.

So I don't know if I'm going in there again tonight or not.

It costs eight bucks.

I got one little clip out of the thing and got some fried bread or whatever they

call it here. In the West, you know,

you get Indian fried bread at carnivals and, and

I don't know, concerts, all sorts of events. Well, they have something here,

but it's, it's called something different. It's like, uh,

I want to say corn roll, but I don't know. It's something different. It,

you know, I saw the name in there, but it was fried bread.

It was the same as Indian fried bread,

only a little bit of a variation on it.

And Indian fried bread is made by the natives in, uh,

in Arizona, at least. I remember it in Arizona, not as much in Nevada,

but mostly Arizona. And that's the Navajo people,

Indian, uh, fried bread. So when I came to Austin, you know,

having the same thing here, uh, and then I was,

I was looking at the guys, uh,

selling it and I started digging up that old tribe kind of

system that's in Arizona. Cause I was wondering why there must've been an old

native tribe here. And the best I could come up with was, uh,

like the Mayans or something, uh,

were here thousands of years ago and that I guess their tribe has long gone.

Whereas, you know, the Indian tribes, you know, uh,

the ones I can remember are Blackfoot Sioux and Navajo

and, uh, Paiute, Shoshone.

So those are all the Indian tribes in the United States.

But this thing is running on like a tribe system.

It's the same like mechanism only, uh, you know,

there's no tribe associated with it.

So the best I can figure is some old Mayan structure is still like running.

But, and that brought me to what the Mayans were and, and, uh, why,

you know,

the Spanish conquistadors kind of took over Mexico to stop the Mayans from doing

whatever they were doing. And the Mayans,

I think it was this closer to family system that, uh, you know,

caused people to have too many kids and then not know what to do with all the

kids they had. So they started going to war everywhere and fighting. And,

and I know they, they got a few pyramids built,

but there were a few tribes in Mexico that existed.

So Inca, Aztec and Mayans. So there were three tribes.

And, uh, this,

this seems to be like a little bit of the structure of one of those and the best

I could come up with is Mayans. And I was thinking, you know,

the tribes in like Navajo and, uh,

Blackfoot, Shoshone, Paiute, all of those still exist,

but they don't really have that closer to family thing in them.

And, uh, I'm wondering if that was the Mayans downfall, uh,

using that closer to family mechanism where people just started having more and

more kids. Uh,

and that's what caused the thing to cave in because it got so big that it just

caused the entire civilization to collapse. Um,

I've looked at Mexico some at some of the old, uh,

ruins of these tribes that existed down there and, uh, wondering, you know,

all these other ones have reservations. So Navajo nation,

there's Navajo reservation, there's Paiute reservation, there's,

um, uh, Sioux, uh,

reservation in Nebraska, uh, Kansas.

And, um, I'm wondering, you know, the Mayans never got a reservation.

If it were up to me, this is another thing. If it were up to me, uh,

I would have found a spot where there's very little fighting. So, you know,

one of the problems with Austin is if this is where they were

in downtown Austin, you know, fighting over the fishing hole. Cause usually,

you know, these other tribes, I know from the native Americans, um,

some of these fishing holes or place where fish grow naturally

in the river or lakes. Um, you know,

one tribal show up and get all the fish and then another tribal show up and

fight with them. And they'll all start fighting over that one fishing spot. Um,

so I'm wondering if this was one of these and, you know,

I know from the natives that some of those fishing spots,

they just avoid entirely because the second they go there,

they start fighting again. So I'm wondering if Austin was one of those.

And that's what happened to this tribe that existed here was when it was

all tribal, you know, everyone started fighting with each other.

And they finally just had to avoid this fishing spot entirely. And then,

you know, the, the Europeans moved in and, uh,

developed a city out of it just, you know, because we do the,

the fishing thing different, uh, you know, with, uh,

agriculture and cattle and all that stuff, that's where the primary,

most of the food comes from, um, with unregulated fishing, you know,

it just turns into fighting all over the place.

So back to what I was saying before building a reservation, you know,

a Mayan reservation would be the coolest thing,

like authentic Mayan reservation that,

uh, you know, is just dedicated to people who, uh,

are Mayan or, or have Mayan ancestry,

and then building the whole reservation around it to where they can do their old

tribal stuff out there and then come back to the city when they want to,

because there's a lot, you get a lot of like interesting ideas.

You get out of Navajo nation in particular,

because that's where I know the best. It's in Arizona, Northern Arizona,

Lake Powell. And, uh, uh, I can't remember.

It goes pretty far South, almost to Phoenix.

Although I think there's a different tribe near Phoenix, but, uh, uh, you know,

they get some interesting ideas out there with that reservation and they're

really interesting to learn from. So having another one that was especially a

Mayan one would, you know, you'd probably get some benefit out of it,

especially if you can maintain the historical significance of that

tribe when it flourished. So anyway, that's my thought. Thank you.

So I've been rolling around all night just like burning off angst and looking

for footage. I was at the Trail of Lights earlier and I rode up the the hill

downtown like a few times and all over the park. So this bicycle has earned its

its value. It's earned its $250 because I've put so many miles on this thing in

the past week just rolling around getting footage. And here's where I am

now. I'm at the Texas Longhorn football stadium and the lights are on. So it's

the middle of the night and the lights are on right now. And I went to one of the gates

that was open and waited for someone to show up and no one ever did. So I rolled

around the entire stadium to try to see if I could find any staff. Finally did.

Asked, you know, because the lights are on already is there any way I could get

footage inside the stadium and they promptly said no. So unfortunately I

won't be able to get the footage I was trying to get which would be inside that

stadium. I've worked a similar job to here. It was just at Boise State

University and this is University of Texas at Austin. But because I live in

Austin now there's a little experience there. And the whole mechanism seems to

kind of work in Austin too. Working event staff, you know, I'd work the concert

hall and then the basketball court concert hall as well. And so the whole

thing seems to work here with the Opera House downtown Austin and then the

University of Texas at Austin Stadium. So it's like the experience carried over.

But I don't know if there's much I can do with it, you know. This content

creation is going pretty well so I'm trying to keep it going as much as

possible. And I'm just trying to learn who to hustle and how to hustle to get

better footage. So there's better content and I make more money and all that stuff.

Anyway, thank you.

So I've been having trouble getting water. One of the drinking fountains, the only one I seem to be

able to roll up to, doesn't work. And so I went to the gas station and bought a smart water

and planned to refill it over and over again, making it not smart water, which I think is funny.

I don't know if everyone does. Probably not as funny as I thought it was when I bought it. You

know, the second you refill the bottle, it's no longer smart water. It becomes not smart water.

Anyway, that's my joke of the evening. Anyway, back, you know, like when I'm in the hotel room

and everything, it's difficult to just drink a glass of water. I always put flavoring in it

or drink a Mountain Dew or drink beer. One of those things, but it's never just direct water.

So now the best I can come up with is just buy a bottle of water and refill it over and over again

to like clear all the soda and crystallite and beer out of there just so I have clear water

to drink. But that's the best solution I can come up with with the gear or situation I'm in.

Anyway, I'm standing out front of the opera again. You know, it's not that late. I thought it was

later than it actually is because I am usually out later at night. I think I'm getting my

sleep schedule better, but I'm at the opera. The park's right next door and

they were having an event earlier, a bunch of skating and stuff, but the doors are always

locked to that thing. You know, I don't know if they have public events or free events inside,

but I have yet to see one. So I'm down here all the time because the bus stop is right next to

the thing and it seems to be closer to where I want to be. But getting my foot in the door in

the opera is not the easiest task in the world. Like I said before, you know, when I worked event

staff, it included both the Boise equivalent of the opera and the Boise equivalent of the Moody

Center. So I'm in Austin now, but it seems to work on the same principle. So I can kind of hover

around these two riding on that experience and be able to create content, which is, you know,

I think the level I'm at now is almost media. You know, I'm just shy of media level. So that's what

I'm doing. I'm going to stay out here. I lost my gloves. I've been having a terrible time with the

gloves. I have a hood and a set or had a set of gloves, but this is the second set of gloves I've

lost just from not zipping my pocket up. So now I have to go find those cheap little gloves because

it's just barely cold enough to need gloves. You know, it's almost warm enough in a week. It's

going to be warm enough again. So it's, you know, I had to just lose them and who knows where they

are because I have been rolling around all over the city, just kind of getting a lot of exercise

and figuring out what would be profitable to continue with. So anyway, thank you.

So I've been riding this bicycle all over the city. I usually go downtown and ride along the bicycle

path a few miles along the river each way. There's a bunch of bridges that are really fun to ride

along. So right along there all over downtown. I've ridden it back the whole way back from downtown

at least once. So it has a lot of miles and it's had a lot of issues. Well some issues.

The first one being this front reflector broke off or fell off. So I finally had to glue it

back on. The brakes keep going out of alignment. I just readjusted them again. So now they grab

right there. But these brakes you get a touch of oil on them and they don't they don't break

very well. So I've seen other people with this bike put better brakes on it. You have to adjust

that cable to to do it but to do the adjustment. But as for actual new brakes it could use them.

That's the only real issue. The shift is working fine. I've oiled it so many times now that

it's covered in oil because it goes through so much gravel on that bike path

that it needs a lot of oil. I added the lights and the center drink holder.

I think that's everything as far as I've gone through with it. The brakes are the only

things I've really needed to adjust. I adjusted the gears a little bit but it has been an absolute ball.

This city is such a bicycle friendly city that it is a great way to get around.

Comparing it to an e-bike, I know e-bikes are a lot faster and bigger and better and all that.

But I really stay in good shape with a regular bicycle. I can lock it up outside more comfortably

because it's so cheap and there's not a lot of stuff you can pull off of it.

So I can lock it outside whereas an e-bike I'd be much more worried about locking it outside.

It's much lighter weight. I can put it on the front of the bus easily and get to where I need to go

without much issue. So I'm really enjoying this bicycle. Thank you very much for the donations

and the just following on TikTok which is what paid for this bicycle in the first place.

It really has come through at giving me better range. I can go farther.

I can work out all my little quirks with it and have a lot of fun. So anyway, thank you.

So I made my way over to the STD clinic, which is right behind me.

But, uh, you know, just like the first time, you know,

I slept for like six hours, maybe less, maybe four hours,

woke up and then couldn't get back to sleep again.

And I have this appointment at 11, but, um, uh,

it's going to rain from like 10 to 11 to 12.

So I came down here early. I don't know, uh,

how to schedule myself correctly.

I have so many little like blips and, and, uh, uh,

weird tremors in the middle of the night that I'm having trouble sleeping.

I can't schedule anything.

And riding down here in the rain would be more difficult. Um,

it's really foggy right now, but I made it down here.

So it's a, it's a 30 minute ride.

I don't know if I should wait until, uh, uh,

just sit out here and wait till 11, uh,

for the appointment or ride back again and then go sit in the hotel room for a

couple hours and then come back down, uh, for the appointment.

So that's what I'm going through. I do enjoy riding this bicycle. You know,

it is still going strong. Uh, I thought I had a flat tire in the rear.

I aired it up quite a bit and now it's holding great.

So, you know, I don't think there's a flat in it. Um, it,

it just did another, uh, Oh, maybe four miles or so.

I don't know how far it went. It's a good ride. You don't,

you think four miles isn't very far, but, but, uh, it,

you feel it when you're actually pedaling the thing.

So there's not much traffic out here. You know,

I'm just finding what footage I can get while I wait for this appointment.

Um, and, uh, see where I can make money anyway. Thank you.

So I'm at the Apple Store trying not to pan around because I don't want to

record anyone without their consent. But I noticed they're trying to get into the arcade game,

arcade business here. And Apple has always been notorious for not doing video games well.

I remember, you know, in like 1990, I got, well, maybe even 1988, I had an Apple IIe.

And you could just play those old green screen, very simple games on it. And then in like

90, 91, we got a color Macintosh Performa. And I could play like Doom 2 on it. That's where I had

Doom 2 originally. So it ran the game terribly. It was the worst gaming system ever. So I ended

up switching to Microsoft after that and then playing video games as much as I wanted. But

I remember the whole way through the 90s, we were having a discussion about, you know,

which is more useful and Apple versus PC, that whole thing. And Apple's were notorious for not

being able to play video games very well. They wouldn't put video cards in them. You couldn't

expand anything. So they were stuck, you know, kind of, they did art really well, but games,

not so much. So I'm wondering if that carried over to now with this arcade thing, to see if

they are able to pull off gaming finally. But this store is absolutely packed. So I'm at the

Domain in Austin and the Apple store is absolutely packed. So they're staying afloat at least.

Anyway, thank you.

So I once again got woken up in the middle of the night. My neighbors were being noisy. You know,

it's a really thin wall hotel room, so neighbors were being noisy and I'd already slept for like

four hours. So I decided to come downtown and work, work out a little bit and then I went and

got Whataburger. And I came to the spot that has got to be my favorite spot in the city.

It is all Austin skyline. So it reminded me, you know, speaking of skylines, it reminded me of that

old Nissan GTR skyline. Like this is what that car was built for, for skylines like this. So

I'll do another pan of it here. I was out doing push-ups and it's nice at night if it wasn't 50

degrees out. Because it's 50 degrees out, it's a little cold. There's a few people still kind

of rolling around, so it's not just me out here. But I'm still trying to get my sleep cycle set

correctly. I'm now operating in the reverse of everything I was before.

Whereas before, you know, I would stay up late, sleep in late. Now it's go to sleep early, wake

up early. But I'm barely through the other side of the thing, so I'm waking up at 2 30. So I have

to get that set a little correctly, a little better. Also, like I said before, I went to the

Planned Parenthood STD clinic and got the full blood work done. But I won't know the results

until Monday, maybe, you know, around Monday. So the only thing I'm really expecting is I probably

have that HSV-1, which is the herpes cold sore periodic infection. And I probably got that when

I was like 18, 19. It's been there a long time. I don't get cold sores very often, but every once

in a while I get one. So that would be the big dreaded herpes. But other than that, you know,

we'll see if anything pops up. It was a gigantic STD test. You know, it tests for everything,

and it costs 20 bucks. So we'll see what the results are. I still have that jock itch,

ringworm infection. And I showed them at Planned Parenthood, and they said they don't have anything,

they don't deal with jock itch or ringworm or fungal infections in any way because it doesn't

classify as an STD. So now I still have to find a general practitioner for jock itch ringworm.

And I'm still running on a prescription I got from an online interview regarding the jock itch

ringworm. And I'm still running on that, but it would be nice to have a doctor actually see the

rash and give their assessment. The people at Planned Parenthood didn't want to bring it up,

and I was just asking for a refill on the prescription I currently have. So I still

have to go see a general doctor for that. But I should be able to get it clear. You know,

it's thinning right out. I think what caused it to blip is I was using, I had fungal shampoo and

then fungal rash cream. And the prescription cream conflicted with the over-the-counter

shampoo. So if I hadn't used the shampoo, I wouldn't have had that conflict in there

and wouldn't have had to stop treatment. So I'm going to keep chipping away at it until it's gone.

I feel strong and healthy. You know, I'm working out. I got my diet set better. I

I pulled out all beer and all sugar. So now I'm just eating regular meals without

any beer or any sugar just to shave off the spare tire I got around my stomach.

You know, I'm 42. So not the youngest person in the world, but I'm trying to stay in good shape.

And there's a lot of people older than me here who are in incredible shape.

So I should be able to get in good, not quite, you know, that 300 chiseled look,

but maybe pretty close. So anyway, that's what I'm working on. Thank you.

I'm sitting waiting for the bus and of course the next one got canceled in eight minutes

So I have to wait half an hour for the next bus

But that gave me enough time to upload one of these clips. I

I've been working on this bicycle. I put a lot of oil on it. So it rolls really well

But I'm staying off the gravel now, so gravels out

But the brakes on the thing are the weakness. I've adjusted them twice

I got them pretty close to snug but

They're still not grabbing very hard. I went to the store and asked him. Is there any way to

Make them grab a little better because I was getting oil on them from oiling the chain too much

And they said put rubbing alcohol on the brake rotors

And that'll that'll clear off any oil on them and fix it so that did seem to help

You know I've been putting rubbing alcohol

You know every time after I ride just to get the oil off of the thing

But now I'm trying to keep my peddling down

Because my legs are so overworked from this thing that like I'm all legs

You know I can't do any upper-body exercise whatsoever. It's just legs

So I was gonna go down to the park today, but I'm headed straight back to the hotel

I may try to go out there tomorrow

Auditorium shores I think is the name of the park I may go down there tomorrow for the New Year's Eve

Celebration apparently there's fireworks and and all sorts of stuff going on, so I'll go down there try to get a clip and

Maybe get some upper-body exercise in rather than just all day every day being legs

So anyway, thank you

So I put a few more miles on this bike,

made it out to this archery store.

I didn't know it was closed today,

but I guess they're closed today and tomorrow.

So I was going to go in there,

but speaking of archery,

you know, ever since I was a little kid,

you know, I had a bow when I was a kid,

a compound, maybe like 30, 40 pound bow.

I think it was my dad's, but I got to use it.

So I learned how to shoot arrows when I was a kid.

And then when I lived in Idaho, when I was like 30,

I don't know, probably 31,

I bought a little Mallard travel trailer

in Spokane, Washington,

and then drove it over the border to Idaho

and went up in the mountains

and lived in that trailer for the summer.

So for like three months, living off grid,

you know, on solar panels and trucked in my own water.

And then I was fishing fish out of the lake

that was right there.

But I bought a compound bow when I was there too.

And it was like a 70 pound bow,

which was really heavy,

heavy pull string on the thing.

And so all I did was target practice with it.

I never actually went hunting,

but at that camp I was at, there were bears everywhere.

There were just those little black bears,

but still bears everywhere.

So there were hunters going through all the time.

I never actually went hunting.

Like I said, you know, everyone else was hunting around me.

I was talking to people while living in the trailer.

It was pretty comfortable the way I had it,

but I did get a lot of archery experience from that.

And I ended up selling that bow in Vegas

to I think an archery store in Vegas.

We got a couple hundred bucks out of it

just because I was done with it.

You know, I never really found a use for the bow.

I was up in Alaska for a while

and the bow was too small for, you know,

even at 70 pounds, I dragged it up with me to Alaska

on one of my trips to Wasilla.

And even at 70 pounds,

it seemed like pretty weak for the bears that were up there.

They said you can get bears with a bow in Alaska,

but that thing was really more designed

for the black bears in Northern Idaho.

So I ended up selling it

because I just couldn't find much of a use for it.

Anyway, thank you.

So I got woken up again in the middle of the night by who knows what. For about a week I was able to

sleep at night all night. You know I was able to sleep through the night but I was getting a lot

of exercise. I was riding the bicycle all the way down to the park downtown and working out down

there all day at the little outdoor fitness area and then riding the bike the whole way back and

then I was able to sleep. But it's been so cold for the past couple days I haven't been able to

ride down there. So you know my sleep cycle is you know it's back to waking up in the middle of the

night and not being able to sleep. So hopefully on Saturday it's going to warm up. It's like 35

degrees outside right now so it's cold. I'm only going to be out for a few minutes. I'm just

uploading this clip. I was taking a little breather from the thing because everyone seems

to be fighting over whether TikTok should shut down or redistribute or whatever they're trying

to do with it. It seems like it's gone through this multiple times so I'm just staying out of it.

I'm not even watching clips on here. I'm just playing Doom and reading the news

and trying to like improve my

desirability so I can actually succeed in life and you know

become something. But as for right now you know I'm still waiting for my face to clear.

I'm trying to meet people in Austin at the park just so I have a few real tangible

connections that can lead to success. So anyway thank you.

So I slept a few hours last night and I set the alarm early.

So maybe, you know, if I wake up early,

I'll go sleep early and have a normal sleep schedule, but, uh,

I, uh, I don't know, you know, still going through,

still have this jock itch and my face is still broken out.

I'm getting pretty jaded about the whole thing. Uh,

all the women on here are too attractive,

too attractive to have a chance with.

So I'm not even watching any of the clips anymore. Uh,

because, uh, it's just frustrating. Um, I'm,

I'm, uh, just now yelling into this thing blind because,

uh, uh, I shouldn't get myself swept up in,

uh, the drama that would without a doubt ensue

if I tried to, uh, uh,

watch any of the clips and just end up, uh, getting teased endlessly.

So I'm not watching any of the clips on here anymore,

but I'll keep telling my little, uh,

updates, uh, about what I'm doing and what I'm going through.

I've been riding the bicycle a little bit. You know,

it's been, uh, rainy for the past month or past week,

maybe. Um, so because of that, you know, I haven't been able to go anywhere,

but, uh, uh, going seven, eight miles to the park,

uh, kind of clears my head of everything and,

and it gives me something to do,

but I'm kind of shutting everything down with the screen on it and,

uh, trying to focus on bettering myself at,

uh, being more, uh, more desirable.

And it's going, you know, like I said before,

I haven't had a date in eight years, so I don't,

it's impossible to think you're going to get one at that point. You know,

it's just there, like everything must be wrong.

So I'm not even bothering. Um,

I'm trying to get more in with, uh, uh, maybe,

you know, the, uh, the guys working out at the park,

if I could get myself in better shape down there, um,

and have a few like references and connections and,

and, uh,

people to vouch for me, that would help.

So that's what I'm thinking about doing as my next step is just, uh,

working at the park and then trying to make friends down there and using that as

a stable foundation for everything. But it,

uh, it hasn't happened yet. It's so cold.

It's hard to motivate myself to go down there. So anyway,

thank you.

So like I've said before, both in my teens, 20s and early 30s, I slept around, I think

I fall under the category of quite a bit. It probably came out, you know, over a hundred

women or something. But I went out and got tested. I think I'd been tested before, but

I just got tested again, full blood work, urine, across the board STD testing, and came

up completely clear. I just called Planned Parenthood and it came up completely clear

of any STDs whatsoever. So negative across the board, which is nice, you know, it's relieving.

But I kind of feel like I dodged a bullet because after sleeping around that much and

not catching anything, you know, I get a cold sore every couple of years, maybe. I'm

still going through this jock itch a little bit, but not catching anything whatsoever.

It's pretty nice. And now I don't know what to do. You know, it's like, if I end up dating

a woman, you know, I'm going to want her to get tested before doing anything. So we're

both guaranteed clear. After dodging that gigantic thing of sleeping around in my twenties

and early thirties. So I hope TikTok, you know, I don't know what's going on with it.

I'm trying to stay out of it as much as possible. I have been uploading to Instagram quite a

bit. So I'm doing Instagram lives and just trying to stay out of what's going on with

TikTok for the time being. I know there's there's alternatives to it that are starting

up and I was looking at them a little bit, but I really like Instagram. So I'm I'm figuring

out Instagram now to see if I can earn a living off of it. So anyway, thank you.

So I'm going through the TikTok shutdown news. I have been uploading to Instagram

more frequently now, and I'm doing Instagram Lives, just playing the guitar on Instagram,

trying to get better at it. So that's what I've been doing during the commotion of the TikTok

shutdown. I don't know what's going to happen with it. You know, they said they were going

to look for a buyer, and then they gave up on the buyer, and now it's supposedly shutting down on

Sunday. So it's a shame. You know, I was getting a paycheck from the thing, and it's a shame they

couldn't work out a deal or work out a way to keep it going. I know, like I said in the other video,

I know there's alternatives that they're trying, but looks like they might shut those down too.

So the United States is really fighting with China a lot, and when I went through history,

you know, Taiwan has always been, it goes from independent to controlled by China,

to independent to controlled by China. So now, you know, China is trying to take over Taiwan,

or at least was, I haven't checked the news recently, at least was, which has happened

all throughout history, you know, and China takes over Taiwan for a while, and then Taiwan

liberates itself, and the cycle repeats itself. So the only thing different this time is the

United States seems to have wedged itself in between China and Taiwan. I don't know if that's

a good idea or not. That might be adding to this commotion on TikTok. It wouldn't be surprising

if it's all because of the United States trying to guard Taiwan and China trying to take over

Taiwan. And I don't know who's right, so I'm staying out of it. Anyway, thank you.

So I've been going through the Instagram transition or using it as an alternative

to TikTok. And TikTok, you know, it has that algorithm that's entertaining.

I don't know. I'm getting a lot. I had a lot more followers on TikTok than Instagram. So

I'm trying to promote Instagram as much as possible now. I really like it. The only real

gripe I have with Instagram is its time limit on videos is a minute and a half.

And on TikTok, it's 10 minutes. So I have to like edit half the video out of Instagram to

make it fit in that minute and a half time limit, which is a shame. You know, I wish it was longer.

I filed a complaint or one of those little petitions on Instagram to extend the time limit

to a more reasonable length. I know it's just for cell phone entertainment.

So having long videos on there, you know, having people watch a movie on their cell phone

may seem a little long. But because it's such a common medium of people, you know,

sitting around various places and the only thing they have on them is their cell phone,

it is an excellent tool for video production because, you know, there's a huge audience

just sitting around everywhere. And having a minute and a half time limit kind of hinders

how much content you can put on the platform. So other than that, I really like Instagram.

I've known about Instagram for 10 years, 15 years, a long time when it first started.

And when it first started, you know, I never thought I was up to Instagram standards. So

I'm pretty happy that, you know, I've been working so hard on looking presentable and

being able to give these speeches better than before that has allowed me to create a successful

Instagram channel, at least for the most part. You know, I'm still working on it,

but it was, you know, it was a hurdle I was never able to cross before. Like in my 20s,

I would try to make Instagram pages and they just wouldn't go anywhere. But now with Reels and being

able to give these speeches, I'm able to get Instagram at least somewhat going. So it's a

shame there's so much going on with TikTok. You know, I read that it was banned in India in 2020,

and the whole thing just shut down in the middle of the night. So I don't know what they're doing.

I'm uploading every last video I can now just to see how it goes. But Instagram is really stable,

you know, you don't have to worry about it shutting down as much. You know, I guess it

could happen there too, but you don't have to worry about it shutting down as much. So anyway, thank you!

Sitting out watching the cars go by and it's reminding me of cars I've had, cars my friends

had, you know, and all the fun we had with those. You know, a few stories to tell was

I had a Subaru WRX STI and a friend of mine had a Z31 which was the old 300ZX from 1986 or

something, 1987 maybe, and it was the turbo and you know the turbo Z in its day was a fast car

but the STI would just hurt the poor thing. So he ended up, he put an air cooler on it

and did all sorts of upgrades and the STI would just still win. The STI bone stock would just

beat the poor thing. So then he got this Z32 300ZX twin turbo and that was a nice car.

That one, I can't remember, you know the STI would win, I have a dig and I think the 300ZX

twin turbo would win at top end but that was an extremely nice car. Like even today,

the 300ZX twin turbo is almost a collectible. I don't think it's quite there but

the sentimental value I had for that car was good because I think I liked it more than he did.

It had a lot of mechanical problems. I think the turbo, one of the turbos or both turbos went in it

and we all kind of pulled the motor out of the thing, put new turbos in it, put the motor back

in and it worked pretty well after that but he ended up selling it and I ended up getting a

Corvette Z06, a 2003 Corvette Z06 and that was the fastest, you know it was over after the Corvette

but that Z32, you know it still struck a chord as being an extremely comfortable,

fun car and the twin turbo was a little problematic but they had normally aspirated

versions of it that were much more reliable and they still had the comfortable like cruise around

T-top feel but they only made 227 horsepower or something like that and so it didn't have the

high speed kind of adventure but looking at it now, looking at all these cars now, that Z32,

you know a normally aspirated Z32 with T-tops is pretty reliable, it has all that classic appeal,

it looks really good in my opinion and they're really cheap so you know because I don't have a

car just looking at cars online, that thing you know it would be fun to roll around in it again.

I had a few other cars you know I had a MX-5, a Mazda Speed MX-5 which was a turbo from the

factory Miata and the second I bring it up you know all that Miata's are gay thing starts

so I gave up on the car and ended up buying that Corvette Z06 but it was a fun car too.

I had a boost controller on, I had exhaust and so it probably had close to 200 wheel horsepower,

maybe like 195 wheel horsepower but it weighed 2,500 pounds so the power to weight ratio was

obnoxious and it was so much fun like a little go-kart just racing around, full turbo spool

sounds and all the fun you could have and then the other car I had was a 2005 E46 M3 which was

also fun, it was great for cruising around but it was too expensive to repair so I ended up selling

the Corvette Z06 was the fastest I had ever owned and ever like been in I think

but I ended up selling it due to reliability issues so that going all the way back though

you know that Z32 looking now with almost no money you're barely making any income,

car I'd probably buy right now it's just that normally aspirated Z32 so anyway thank you.

So I'm going through this TikTok rollercoaster.

Last night, you know, I checked it at like midnight

or maybe 1 a.m. and it gave that error message

that it had shut down.

And then someone messaged me on here

saying it was back up again.

So I went and looked and sure enough,

they restarted TikTok.

I don't know what's going on.

It's much more difficult to trust

whether TikTok is gonna be there after the shutdown.

Now, apparently it's ranked on that 90-day extension,

although no one really knows what's going on,

but apparently they wanted it restarted

for the inauguration.

And I don't know, you know, I like Instagram plenty.

I wish the video length was longer,

but they're pretty similar to each other

when you compare them side by side.

The only real catch is, you know,

TikTok has a 10-minute video length.

Instagram has a minute and a half video length.

But I'm having trouble getting as swept up in TikTok

as I was before, just because it just went

through a shutdown, a government shutdown.

Who knows how long it's gonna last.

I hope it does well.

I've enjoyed it for years.

I made a lot of content on there or on here.

I'm posting this on both Instagram and TikTok.

So I've made a lot of content on TikTok,

but we'll see what its future is.

I'm probably not gonna trust it as much as I did before.

Anyway, thank you.

So I'm trying to work up courage for this OnlyFans thing.

I went out because I think I'm on a different sleep cycle than everyone else.

That's what's been causing my sleep schedule issues is,

you know, I should probably stay kind of with the bar crowd and the bar crowd

goes to sleep at like 2.33.

So that's usually when I go to sleep, you know,

when I get everything set correctly.

So I'm trying to, uh, uh,

work up the courage to put content on OnlyFans because it's a different job

than I'm used to. So, uh, I'm learning because I'm well-endowed, you know,

that's, that's the, uh, direction I pretty much have to go in to earn a living.

Um, everything else, you know, like I was saying, jams up, uh,

to where I, I can't get in others.

So I'm working on OnlyFans. I'm working on Instagram a little too.

It's a shame about TikTok. Um, I wish they,

uh, uh, were able to work out, you know,

a better deal than what's happening currently, but it's a shame.

Uh, the Supreme Court already ruled that TikTok is out.

Um, and then it got a 90 day extension from the president. So, uh,

it's, I don't know how it's going to play out,

but it doesn't look good. Um, they've been trying to get a buyer for years,

but, uh, it hasn't happened. So, uh, you know,

I enjoy it. I'm glad it exists. I wish it would continue existing,

but it's not up to me, um, what its fate is. So, uh,

I'm going to keep uploading until it doesn't work. Anyway. Thank you.

So I'm feeling wobbly after posting content on OnlyFans, which I'm trying to promote,

and it is paying, so I am earning money from OnlyFans, just charging for pictures.

And thank you everyone for buying the pictures. I'm going to keep working at it. It is a completely

different job and everything from doing normal content creation on Instagram and TikTok.

So I'm still getting used to it. I'm going to keep trying to post content on there and

see, you know, what I can make out of it. Because I had a huge Vegas party phase

in my mid, early, mid and late 20s, you know, I'm still, I'm kind of in that bracket.

You know, there's a lot of pool parties and women staying over. So I'm like, you know,

there shouldn't be anything stopping me from doing OnlyFans in the first place,

plus being well-endowed, you know, that adds to it. So I'm trying to make it as successful

as possible. It seems like a fun job, you know, once you get to the pool parties and everything,

you know. Right now I'm still at the bottom barrel of the thing. So anyway, thank you.

So I'm compensating for the surge OnlyFans created. Thank you for all the purchases,

but I had to pause a little bit and just slow the whole thing down to be able to continue

stably because, you know, it's a completely different animal, so to speak. So anyway,

to do that, I'm playing a lot of Doom and I got the Doom franchise on my laptop here. It's just

the classic bundle, but I played through Doom 1, 2, 3, the two expansion packs for 3, Doom 64,

and I'm halfway through Doom 2016, which is the newest, latest, and greatest. Well,

it's the newest I'm going to be able to play because this laptop is just an i3, so it won't

it won't play Doom Eternal or Doom Dark Ages, which is the latest one coming out in May.

So I'm sticking with it. 2016 runs pretty well on it. Doom 2016, but I have to run it at the

lowest video settings to get a decent frame rate out of the thing, but it's completely playable.

Doom 3 was really good. I remember when Doom 3 came out, it got mixed reviews. It wasn't

considered the strongest in the Doom franchise or anything, but playing it now at full settings and

just getting the full experience, it was really good. So Doom 3, you know, it was, I don't know,

they have everything on discount right now, so it was like two or three dollars per game

is what it came out to. It wasn't much. So I got a lot of playtime out of them,

plus all the mods available for Doom 1 and 2. I played through all the featured mods for Doom

1 and 2 when I had that Chromebook. I was just playing through the the mods on it. So

that's what I've been doing. I wish multiplayer, you know, I brought up multiplayer on Doom 2016.

It looks like it's done. You know, there's no one there, so everyone's probably in Eternal.

I'm really enjoying the franchise. It's made in Dallas, Texas. The software developers are

in Dallas and I'm in Austin, so I like purchasing Texas products and Doom would be the best Texas

product because I had Doom 2 for a Macintosh Performa in 1992 or 3. So it was the first

computer video game I ever played and it made an impression on me as a 10 or 11 year old child.

So growing up, you know, I'm glad I had Doom as an anchor to pull me through whatever

instabilities I would create in my life. You know, I could just play Doom and kind of escape.

So that's what I've been doing. I'm gonna keep working on OnlyFans and get more content on

there. Keep uploading on TikTok and Instagram and just see how far I get. Anyway, thank you.

So I'm getting more comfortable on OnlyFans, although it's still going through the transition

of the thing. But I did get some money in from the posts I made. I'm at 546, I think,

and it's still kind of coming in a little bit. It looks like the peak went down of the thing,

so it's slowing down. I'm still uploading content on there and just learning how to

make it work. Because TikTok is so unstable, they haven't put the app back at the App Store

and it's not available on Google Play anymore. So who knows what's going on with TikTok.

I decided to go try other sites to see if I could earn a living, and OnlyFans worked.

So I'm pretty happy with it. Thank you for all the support. I'm going to continue

uploading videos on all three platforms, OnlyFans, TikTok, and Instagram,

just to see what comes through and tell my life story to see if anyone can learn from it.

I'm going to keep working on this thing. Anyway, thank you.

So I just checked how much money I've made and I'm at exactly $666 well not exactly $666.40 so I don't know you know signs of the devil I've been playing doom too much you know it's an adult site it is only fans so um that you know I was just having a conversation about marketing and pricing and how to price a new account um because this thing's brand new I'm just charging three

dollars for content and that's just to build up enough of a following to make it succeed so I don't know what the correct pricing should be I'm sticking with three dollars for the time being but I don't want to have anyone complain about it you know if you market if you price it too high the audience complains if you price it too low the other creators complain

so I'm trying to find the balance in all that I'm not looking at any other accounts on this thing I'm just trying to figure out the basics of it and see how much money it can make and and how well it'll do um going forward so uh I'm I'm open to ideas on what pricing should be

and where I should set the pricing on here because the minimum is three dollars and that goes up to whatever so anyway thank you

So I just wanted to show you that stunt made a thousand bucks. So it's kind of leveling off now.

I think I still have to pay taxes on it. So I'm at $1,091.20 and it's still crawling up,

but the surge has passed. So now I'm just working on advertising and how to promote the page

because it is making money and you know you have to make money somewhere. So

that's legal income. I'm going through everything with the audience and with how to

put better content because TikTok appears to be done. I'm not getting much at Instagram.

I would have to boost the reels I have on there which cost money. So I'm looking for things that

pay money not cost money and this one pays money so I'm sticking with it. But making the little

mini movies on the thing. I'm still learning how to edit. I switched editing to my laptop. I was

editing on the cell phone but I'm using this Microsoft Clipchamp editing software. So now I'm

editing on the computer instead which should be I should be able to make more complicated like

interesting videos that way. But that's about as far as I've gotten. I'm trying to learn as I go

how to get OnlyFans working. So a I don't upset anyone and b so I make money. You know I'm trying

to get the thing working so you know I don't step on any toes and I learn from people who've been

doing this much longer than I have. So that's what I'm working on now. Anyway, thank you!

So I made my way down to the park today. It was a good hour, hour and a half long

bus ride to get down here. So it's late in the afternoon but finally was able to

get the guitar out and bring it down here. I'm thinking you know the more I'm

seen with the guitar the better I'll get at it. You know I'm still like absolute

basic skill level on the thing. But you know it seems like a foolproof strategy

of just being visible with a guitar and then I'll probably just slowly get

better that way. So I'm probably gonna be out here for most of the day at least

until the Sun goes down. The headlight got stolen off my bicycle so I don't

have a headlight anymore. Which means I can't be out at night as much.

Because I slept in you know I'm still having trouble sleeping at night so I

slept in till like noon and finally got down here at 4. So it only gives me a

couple hours to to be here. But hopefully you know this strategy will pay off.

Anyway thank you.

So I'm going through my finances and I made a good $1,300 so far on oaf.

Apparently I'm only supposed to say oaf. I didn't know that before, but oaf I guess.

So I made $1,300 there and still had about $2,800 I think from that viral video that

went viral like six months ago. All I've been doing is buying groceries with the money

because it's hard to predict when the next paycheck is going to come in.

I'm just saving money and only buying food with it because food's more important than

than anything else. I'm going to see how long I can make this $3,000 last.

I got $4,500 or $5,000 four months ago and so I'm probably spending $300 a month on average.

So it should last a while because I'm just stuck in this position. I can't really do anything.

I'm doing my best to just tell my story on here and I guess oaf is considered employment, but

it had a good payday starting out and I hope I can get that to stabilize to a consistent income.

Like I've said before, I used to do IT, network administrator for golf courses in Las Vegas,

and I went all the way up to server repair, server replacement, backups, databases,

stuff like that. So I don't know if I could work my way up to just going back to doing IT

because the whole thing seems pretty similar.

Oaf versus golf courses that are very closely tied to casinos,

no one likes their data getting out in those. Both of them. Oaf and those golf courses,

they don't want data going anywhere. They don't want it going in the cloud.

They don't want backups going to some weird location. No one knows where it is.

So back when I did that, I did that job for six years. Back when I did that, I was really strict

that the backups stayed on site and then once a week they were transferred to either my house or

one of the manager's houses. And so we just had a once a week take home backup external hard drive

that worked pretty well. And it didn't go out into the cloud. It didn't go to some who knows

what operation because I just bought this Windows laptop and everything I put on it now seems to go

in one cloud or another. It's got one drive. It's got another one. I can't remember the name of it.

It's got like three clouds built into the thing. So the second you put a picture on there,

it goes into three different clouds. Oh, and Google backup is on there. So there's like

four different clouds. Anything you put on the computer just goes into for who knows what reason.

So it took forever, but I was able to disable them all, which did me a favor because I was tired of it

uploading all this data across a very slow network to begin with

for, you know, to go into four clouds simultaneously. So I'm kind of done with

cloud anything, but I'm sure other people share my sentiment about it.

So that's what I've been doing lately. Anyway, thank you.

So I'm still going through all this, and the biggest, most important thing I seem to need

to say is I'm completely straight. You know, I've always been completely straight. I don't expect

that to change at any time soon. So I've always been straight. I'm still straight. I'll probably

always be straight. So, you know, trying to get through this oaf thing, and this has been a

problem before where I'll just get hit on too much by guys. And, you know, I try to be courteous. I

try to explain my side of everything because I'm social. I like working together with people,

and I like making new friends. So, you know, those three things, you know,

I don't mind, you know, what their thing is or what they're into. I don't care. But I am

straight. So it creates this kind of weird conflict. And now, you know, I just kind of avoid

and block any messages or locations that are gay. So that's what I've been doing. I don't know how

this whole adult entertainment thing got so overwhelmed with gay and lesbian people.

Because I was born well-endowed, as I've said, you know, many times that, you know, I'm kind of

stuck with this industry. And so well-endowed and completely straight seems to create this weird

situation where I don't know if there's a different type of interview process or how it works.

But that's where I'm kind of stuck now that I'm trying to figure out. I'm posting as much content

as I can on Oath and plan on continuing because it's making good money. Or at least it started

out making good money. Now it kind of teetered down. So I'm trying to get through, you know,

it had that opening surge and then kind of went down a little bit. So I'm still learning

how to make it work. But that's what I'm doing lately. Anyway, thank you.

So I put more content on Oaf. I'm still learning the ropes of the thing, so to speak.

I've done all this before. It was probably 10 years ago, maybe 15 years ago. I lived in Vegas.

I broke up with my girlfriend at the time and just ended up uploading pictures online until

I started picking up other women in Vegas. That's what cascaded into a downward spiral

that I had to retreat from and move out of Las Vegas. So I've been doing it for a while.

I'm putting more content on there because TikTok, who knows what's going on with it.

Oaf does pay more, so I'm sticking with it. It has paid more at least up to this point.

Because I've been on TikTok so long, just looking at the models and all the other

clips on there, I've gotten a lot of the modeling training. So rather than letting all that go to

waste, I'm like, well, I might as well see if I can get some money out of this. So that's why I

started Oaf. Anyway, I'm going to keep trying to upload when I can. I'm kind of slowing down TikTok

uploads. I'm going to keep going on Instagram and Oaf, obviously. But because there's so much

turmoil going on with it, I don't know if I even want to get re-swept up in the thing.

So anyway, thank you!

So it's been 20 degrees out at least today. I think it was cold yesterday. It's supposed to

be cold tomorrow. That's really cold for Austin. So this is the coldest week of the year or I

think that I've been here. So I'm pretty stuck indoors. I cleaned up a little and got the

bicycle in a new bicycle location. So it's stored up there and then I keep the acoustic guitar out

to kind of think about it more because it could be a money maker. And then yesterday I bought

Kerbal Space Program which is an old space video game that I played when it first came out like 10

years ago. It was some free open source video game I think like 10 years ago. And so I played

it then and I was happy to see it on there and it gives me something to do while it's so cold outside.

I've noticed my teeth are starting to get sore. So you know I'm not eating any sugar and I shrunk

down beer considerably to try to get my teeth to repair because I'm still not making enough

money for a dentist. So it's all solely relying on how much dental hygiene I can maintain.

And so I'm using all the repair toothpaste and you know like I said trying to keep sugar

and beer out of my system. But all my teeth are original. I have two sore spots that I'm just like

putting as much toothpaste on as possible. But the rest you know it's all original teeth.

So I'm trying to maintain that as long as possible. And because you know I'm still not making a

genuine cash flow income that can pay for a dentist. You know I'm stuck in this situation.

So I'm gonna keep playing around on Kerbal and keep uploading to the three sites I'm uploading to

and just see what happens. Anyway, thank you!

So I've been cooped up for a day or two. I don't know how long. I decided to take a walk.

It's still, you know, in the 20s outside, which is cold. It is, it is cold. There's still people

sleeping outside. So I don't know, you know, I was homeless for a few years and I went through

one, I think there was one cold spell in Florida and in Southern California where it was in the

20s. And in Florida, I built a huge bonfire and stayed warm by it, but I was in a tent in the

middle of the jungle. So I could build a fire out there and no one even knew it was there.

And I stayed pretty warm with that thing, but it's pretty frigid. I'm very thankful to have

that hotel room. I'm doing everything in my power to earn a living to the best of my ability,

which is what I've been doing. So I'm going to go walk back upstairs and be thankful to

have a heater. Anyway, thank you.

So I've been playing Kerbal Space Program instead of Doom recently, and I played through every Doom

game. Doom 1, 2, 3, the three expansion packs, all the master levels for Doom 2, and

I think like 20 or 30 of the the mods, the featured mods for Doom 1 and 2,

and also played through Doom 2016 multiple times. So I played too much Doom and so I

ended up downloading Kerbal Space Program, and this is my foolproof rocket to get to Mars.

I've only made it so far this go-around, getting the rocket in almost orbit with Mars.

I keep running out of fuel for it when I get close to Mars with this thing, but it does make it.

It's a rocket of my own design. I didn't use one of the pre-made ones, so I kind of threw this

thing together. It has issues. It kind of wobbles and sometimes falls apart on its own,

but it has made it to Mars orbit. So this would be the exact way

I can foresee to get there, because I've said on here multiple times,

don't go to the moon, and where I got that idea was I was sleeping in a tent in

central Florida, just right next to Kennedy Space Center. I was out in the jungle.

This is where it was really cold and I was building bonfires to stay warm, but it was

really close to where they were doing rocket launchers, so I could watch the rocket launches

fly overhead while I was sleeping there, which was fun. Then you start thinking

about space and everything to do with it, and I came to the conclusion that avoiding the moon

entirely was the best bet. If you have too many people flying up there and landing and cruising

around and doing all sorts of stuff to disrupt it, you're kind of shifting how it's

moving around the Earth. So it's going to start shifting around from all this

commotion there, and that it can only cause problems. I don't see anything positive coming

from it. You know, the Earth's climate would be adjusted then by the moon being getting moved

around. So I came to the conclusion that just avoiding the moon entirely was the best bet.

So now when I'm playing Kerbal Space Program, I avoid the moon entirely in this thing.

I'm just going to Mars. So this is like a one-way trip to Mars rocket, and I've been

at this thing for years just because, you know, being from Nevada, I really, as even as a very

small child, I thought about Mars a lot. I remember thinking, one of my first memories

was thinking that parts of Wyoming and Nevada look like the surface of Mars,

and wondering how we would be able to get there. So, you know, this, I am really ingrained to Mars

from all of that, from years and years and years. And Doom, the entire Doom franchise takes place

on Mars. So, you know, I have always kind of locked into Mars as, you know, if we get to space,

the only destination is Mars, you know. So that's what kind of has me always heading in that

direction. But, you know, I'm keeping an eye on the space program some, you know, all the different

rockets going up, and all these little startup projects that are trying to build space planes

and space rockets, and seeing how it goes. So anyway, thank you.

So, uh, like always, you know, I can't sleep and I'm running out of things to say on here.

Uh, I, uh, I don't know, you know, maybe it's, it's after TikTok getting shut down

and then restarted, you know, is it going to get shut down again?

That made me so nervous that I just started an oaf account and went there.

Um, just so I can say, oh, I'm working for, uh, for oaf instead of TikTok. Cause there's no way

to know if TikTok is going to work. It did dig me up off the side of the road in Florida.

So I owe it for that. But you know, uh, it's, uh, it's getting more and more difficult to,

uh, post clips on here. So, uh, like I said, you know, I'm on my second cold walk at the night,

trying to cool off or get some exercise or wind down or whatever. Um, and, uh, yeah,

I think it's like 29 degrees outside right now. I have two jackets on. It's cold though. You know,

I can only be out for a little bit and I have to go back inside. I think, you know, I, uh,

I spent a lot of time in cold weather climates, but that was a long time ago. So I think I've

adjusted to warm weather now and just don't want anything to do with the cold. Um, that's why I'm

so appreciative to have that hotel room, but, uh, it looks like the wifi is down there again.

So, uh, you know, can't, can't really do much. Um, so I'm out walking around, uh, kind of,

uh, cooling off, you know, just as I said before, making sure I don't get upset or angry or,

or, um, uh, cause any issues because the, the walls are extremely thin in that hotel room.

So I can't make any noise whatsoever in the room. I have to go out somewhere to make any noise

whatsoever. And, uh, that's why I ended up walking out here just, you know, for, for days on end,

not making any noise whatsoever. Uh, you know, you get pent up from it. So, uh, walking seems

to help. I didn't bring the bicycle with me this time. I'm just walking, uh, uh, short range and

then, uh, trying to come up with content ideas and then walking back. So it's supposed to be

cold for a few more days, but then it warms up to like Tropic weather, uh, temperatures. So I

can't wait for the Tropic weather temperatures because surprisingly, despite Austin being, uh,

so far South, this has been a long month of cold weather. Uh, the last month has been cold. Um,

I haven't been able to go to the park at all. There was one day, you know, one warm day in

the past month and the rest has been cold. So, uh, I'm happy to see the summer come around

and get through all this. So anyway, thank you.

Well, I was going to go to the bar tonight, but it's too cold.

You know, uh, it's about, it's maybe two miles, three miles to Busty's.

And, um, it, it's too cold to ride the bike that far.

So I just made a Walmart and got groceries and I'm going back.

It's supposed to warm up in a few days.

And I'm also thinking, you know, I'm trying not to spend too much.

Uh, you know, I may just go in there and have a glass of water and just kind of

be seen, uh, because, uh,

I've only made 1500 bucks on oath now, I think. So it's some money,

but it's not like, not like I'm getting rich right now from it.

So, um, that's what I'm going through. Uh,

I'm standing out here. I've been cooped up in the apartment too long.

So I just started riding around in circles on the bicycle to just kind of get

all the pent up out. And, uh, uh, it turned out, you know,

it's like 34 degrees or something and,

and all my clothing is more for summer than winter. So, uh, in a few days,

you know, I'll be out more hopefully, but, uh, it's a shame. You know,

if I had a ride, I would have gone down there,

but riding a bicycle all that way is difficult.

And so I'm just going to stay in the apartment tonight. Anyway. Thank you.

So I'm stuck awake again all night. You know, I slept all day. I'm still in this kind of reverse

sleep schedule thing. It's supposed to snow at some point. I haven't seen any precipitation,

but it's supposed to snow. It's only a 20 percent chance, but still, you know, snow in Austin is

interesting. So, you know, it'd be fun to see. I missed the first one. There was only one other

snowstorm this winter, and I missed it. I slept right through. So it looks like there's little

like particles coming down the snow. Anyway, I've been working on Oaf and Instagram and TikTok,

and this poor cell phone, you know, I'm trying to get its camera working to full potential.

Like, taking pictures with the thing are coming out grainy and blurry, and some of the videos,

you know, just don't focus at all. So I'm looking at cameras, and I don't even know where to start.

There's like those handheld camcorders. There's the flat, a little flat pocket camera, which is

probably what I'm most interested in, for like 70 bucks. It's just a flat vlogger camera,

and it looks like it would do the job. And then there's those big professional ones

at the camera store, but they're way too expensive. So because, you know, my claim to

success at this point was receiving a $100 donation in Florida, sitting on the side of the

road, I went out and bought a tablet with it for 60 bucks, and then started yelling into the tablet

and uploaded the video, and that's what started this whole thing. So I'm sticking with that,

and that means, you know, a camera might be a good investment, because it has been the sole

reason for my success post-Vegas party days. You know, I was pretty successful in Vegas party days,

but I had to leave the whole thing because it got too dangerous, and I don't want to go to

Vegas at all. You know, I don't want anything to do with it these days. I like it here.

I'm all of Nevada. You know, I don't want to be there. I like Texas. I like Florida.

So I'm happy where I am. I don't want to go back to any of it. I'm not

longing the past or anything like that. I'm happy. The way I did it was plenty of fun.

Don't want to go back. Don't want to get associated with anyone in there,

and really like Austin. Austin is probably my favorite spot. Because I've been playing Kerbal

Space Program, you know, I'm getting back into space again, and, you know, just learning about

space, and I did finally get a rocket to crash into the surface of Mars in Kerbal Space Program,

but I can only like stand one launch per day in that game. Like I can only play through one launch,

and I have to take a break for a day, and like recharge my thought process for

playing Kerbal Space Program. And then, so I did get a pod to crash at a very high velocity

into the surface of Mars, but I'm going to keep working at it. I really like that game.

I kind of doomed myself out. You know, I was ready for a change of pace, so Kerbal Space Program

is just that. Anyway, going back, you know, this whole thing is based on using a camera.

So investing in a camera is probably the best choice at this point. It's been working so well.

I wish TikTok was a little more stable. You know, I got three of these things running right now,

TikTok, Instagram, and Oath, and I wish TikTok was a little more stable, but it's really up to them

to decide, you know, I guess what's safe for the United States and what's not. But I hope it

stays open, you know, and just, you know, if you don't like the thing, stay off of it. You don't

need to, like, shut it down or attack it, you know. If you don't want it, just don't use it.

Use something else. So anyway, that's my opinion on it. Anyway, thank you.

So my teeth have gotten so sore now that I can't have any sugar whatsoever. I can't drink any beer.

So I'm postponing the camera idea and going to try to find a dentist to get that clear.

And the jock itch continues, although it's extremely small. I'm taking two showers a day.

There's nothing visible except for a little spot on my leg. And I'm using, I don't know,

Locherman's antifungal spray and this EmuAid Max Amazon antifungal cream.

And I've been doing that two times a day for the past year. So I like to think it's shrunk down,

but, you know, it's this constant war. I don't know what the deal is. I tried to go to the hospital

and have it looked at and was unable to secure funding for the hospital visit. So I left,

didn't just talk to the receptionist, left, and a few months later got a letter in the mail that

I owed them $800 for medical treatment I never received. So, you know, maybe I can make some

money just suing the hospital for that and then pay for this fungal rash to be cleared.

That's the best I can come up with, with this bottom end. Still working on, you know, it's

getting a few bucks in, but I don't know. I had a pretty good size tidal wave built up

to get that thing to kick over, but I don't know how long it's going to last or how

stable the income's going to be. So I'm going to keep working at it to see if I can get a few bucks

in with that. It's just to pay for like the dentist and a hospital visit or a doctor's visit

to have a fungal rash inspected. That's where this money's going. So that's what I'm doing.

I'm back sitting outside again. I was hoping it was going to snow. You know, I said that earlier

that maybe it'll snow. It was like a 20% chance. It's kind of still like sparkling down a little

bit, but there's no actual snow. So I'm stuck awake all night, like always, and I'm like

kind of bored sitting here, sitting in front of a soon-to-be-open 7-Eleven. They've been

working on this thing for two years, and it still is like going, you know, still in construction

phase. So hopefully it'll be open pretty soon. I would walk in there right now if it was open

and just get some, but it's too far to the other one. So I end up just walking back and forth here

on the sidewalk just to, you know, get out of the hotel room, get out of the apartment for a little

bit, cool off. You know, I'll try to lay down because I really want to be able to sleep at night

and be awake during the day. It just doesn't happen. You know, I end up sleeping during the

day and being awake at night. So, you know, I keep trying to like force myself to sleep at night

and just won't. You know, I'll end up getting frustrated trying not being able to sleep

and then being more awake just because I'm frustrated. So that's why I'm out walking around

I don't know. I don't have much else. You know, I'm trying to talk into this thing as much

as possible, at least while TikTok's still around, and see what comes through. Anyway, thank you.

So I've been trying to maintain complete honesty on here as much as possible. You know, whatever

whatever nuance or secret or vulnerability, I'm just telling the story about it. It's gotten me

this far just, you know, telling whatever's on my mind, unfiltered, and being completely honest

about everything. So I'm gonna keep going with it and see how far I get. You know, I've

been talking into this thing for a few years and because I have these horrible sleepless nights,

you know, standing around, sitting around wide awake all night, you know, there's

there's not much I can do. So uploading to TikTok, Instagram, and Oaf

kind of works. You know, it works with not being able to sleep at night because I can

sit and like premeditate a speech and then give that speech. So it doesn't look like it snowed

tonight. You know, it's raining now, but there never was any snow. So I never got my snow wish.

I, like I said, I missed the first one. So, you know, I kept coming out over and over again to

see if there'd be snow on the ground and there hasn't been. You know, it's like just above

cold enough for it. It's like 34 and snow would be 32, I guess. I'm still lacking transportation

to go anywhere. It's supposed to warm up in a few days. So I'll be able to at least ride the

bicycle, you know, in my couple mile radius around here. And I was thinking about, you know,

going to see a dentist. It might be about time to see a dentist. Every time I brush my teeth,

you know, they're they're showing moderate sensitivity. And I keep like piling on that

Sensodyne repair toothpaste and it's just not doing it. So it might be about time to get my

teeth looked at. Because I got my face mostly clear, you know, I don't look like a train wreck

all the time. And, you know, it seems to be getting a more positive response. So I'm trying

to keep it that way. You know, I'm doing like face treatment galore and all sorts of different

stuff to get it clear. So anyway, thank you.

So I made my way down to Busty's and it took, you know, it's 40 degrees outside, so it's a long

full bicycle ride, but it feels good, you know. I'm happy to have that bicycle ride around because

it really, like, burns off all the angst, right, or restlessness, whatever. And so once again,

I slept all day, but it's Saturday night, so I decided to come down here. I'm just getting

a glass of water. I'm still not making much mice, and I'll find it. Busty's a really good spot. It

reminds me of, like, Nevada. Texas, you know, the Texas and Nevada thing goes pretty well

because, you know, I can say I'm from Winnemucca, Nevada, living in Austin, Texas,

and they both just sound good together. And the whole Winnemucca, like, mechanism works in Austin.

So I'm really happy to be here. I hope to get into some kind of successful position

and just keep working on the social media. I just bought a new camera for $75,

so we'll see how it goes. I'm still using this cheap little cell phone for all the video.

So once I get that camera, you know, I should be able to upload video in.

And it gives me something to do. Like I said before, this is the sole reason my success,

the sole reason for me not sitting on the side of the road is just talking into the cell phone

over and over again, telling how my day was and what I'm doing, and that's what's working. So I'm

just going to keep investing in it until something pans out. Anyway, thank you.

So I'm standing out here in the rain, never did get any snow,

but, uh, I was playing Kerbal Space Program. I, uh, got a,

a rocket to almost land on the surface of Mars, but,

uh, uh, I, uh, kind of botched the landing and the whole thing blew up except for

one fuel tank, one fuel tank started rolling down the hill.

And it reminded me of when one time I drove up to Alaska in a

Ford F-150 and, uh, did the Dalton Highway,

which is the most difficult, uh, road to drive I've ever been on.

It, uh, it is long, it is gravel, it's Arctic. I drove,

I made it one time all the way to Prudhoe Bay, Dead Horse, Alaska.

And, um, it's the farthest North you can drive to in

North America, I think. Uh, so I made it all the way up there.

And I tried to do it a second time and was unable to, uh, you know,

I kept having problems at the truck, uh, you know,

courage, working up courage to drive that thing again. So I gave up,

I went bankrupt and that's when I flew down to LA and,

and was homeless for years. And that whole thing started. But anyway,

going back to Dalton Highway in Prudhoe Bay, Alaska. Uh,

I, uh, I was thinking about space when I was up there and

now looking at a Starship and SpaceX and how they're trying to go to

Mars with Starship. Uh,

it reminded me of Prudhoe Bay and driving through the Arctic. Uh,

you know, getting a Rover or little, you know,

RC car or a bunch of RC cars, uh,

landed safely on Mars would make money. I mean, just guaranteed you would need,

you would need to set up like networking satellites. I don't know, you know,

I haven't gotten that far into it, but you know,

you'd have to be able to stream a lot of data from Mars to earth.

So you need a lot of satellites and then you have all these little RC cars rolling

around everywhere, but that sure would make money.

And that sure would give that like giant tin can something to do. Uh,

just having a bunch of Mars Rovers roaming around everywhere.

So, uh, you know,

I don't know how feasible it is or how close a Starship is even to

launching.

Everyone's getting so swept up in the moon that I've determined is a total waste

of time. Uh, anything to do with the moon, it's a waste of time.

It can do damage. You know, it can cause more harm than good.

So I, I avoid and, uh,

protest against any moon, uh, mission whatsoever,

just nothing to do with it. Um, but Mars on the other hand is wide open.

So, uh, you know, landing as much junk on Mars as possible,

uh, would be fun. And I don't think it would cause any problems. Uh,

you know, they,

they get concerned about microscopic life on earth that,

you know, you carry to, to Mars and then it spreads everywhere and causes some

like gigantic pandemic or something. I, that doesn't seem very feasible.

Uh, you know,

I would be dumping all sorts of life forms up there and, uh,

just seeing how they do. Uh, it, uh,

it doesn't seem like it would evolve into anything that terrible, um,

to cause that much issue. But, um, uh,

looking at RC cars, you know, how they're jumping them around.

They go like 60 miles an hour.

Having one of those on Mars would be a really good highlight reel, you know,

because everyone's just staring at their cell phone screen, computer screen,

TV screen, putting content on the screen is what sells.

And, uh, you know,

having video or live stream footage of Mars

surface with a bunch of rovers rolling, rolling around would make money.

It would make quote unquote money. Uh, you know,

cause cash piles around everywhere and it seems like they just don't have any

money. They have a lot of cash, but like no value or no, uh,

no substance to it. Whereas this, uh, this would be quote,

unquote money, just having content live,

live or video footage of the Martian surface, uh, with stuff rolling around,

you know, you're going to have an event out of the thing. Um,

have a bunch of those RC cars driving around in circles,

jumping around or whatever. And, uh, it would be a pretty good cash flow.

So anyway, thank you.

So I'm still, yeah, I'm stuck awake all night, uh, was looking, was watching clips of that old, uh,

British Airways Concorde, which they, they stopped in 2003. But the, uh, the reason, first off,

back when I liked airplanes, you know, after a plane crash, you don't like airplanes anymore.

It's pretty quick to just not want to be near an airplane. Um, but back before the plane crash,

the, uh, Concorde was one of my favorites, if not my favorite. You know, uh, it, it just,

it looked incredible. Uh, it was the fastest plane, you know, that was commercial,

that you could ride on. And so, uh, what brought this whole thing up was the Concourse Project,

which is like a warehouse rave near, uh, the airport here in Austin. Um, the name of that

thing, Concourse Project, just reminds me of the Concorde. So I immediately start watching

videos of the Concorde. And what brought that up was I was at Busty's and, uh, you know,

I could only sit there for like five minutes before getting restless. So, and I can't drink

because my teeth are too sore to drink anything. So, you know, alcohol's out. All I can do is sit

there and drink water and like come up with clips to upload. So, uh, so that's why I'm not,

not going out or not doing anything. Also, you know, not having transportation isn't helping.

I can ride the bus and then bicycle to Concourse Project. The bicycle is helping

with just calming down. You know, it's just exercise. It's clean. Uh, it helps me calm down.

So, you know, that helps. Um, but trying to get a clip of the Concourse Project is difficult from

where I am. And I was thinking about trying to get one, uh, you know, one of these nights, but,

uh, you know, it's, it's so difficult to get around anywhere that, uh, I had to give up on it.

Um, I, uh, I was also, you know, I was going through the whole space, space thing still. And, uh, uh,

you know, thinking about the Concorde, you could attach the Concorde on the side of like a rocket

and then have a very luxurious space shuttle that would probably just blow up. But, you know,

it would look really good before blowing up. So those are all my ideas on that old Concorde.

I know they're digging up, uh, the past of the thing, which is partially what brought it up

because, uh, the airlines are trying to make, um, supersonic jets. And I remember as a very small

child up until I was like 11 years old, we had a ranch in Nevada and, uh, it was, uh, south of

Winnemucca, like an hour and on 160 acres, but the fighter jets would fly over all the time. All the

fighter jets from whatever, uh, military bases are out there, probably Fallon, but everyone wants to

talk about Area 51. I think it was Fallon Air Force Base where they were flying in and out of.

And they would break the sound barrier over the house and it would cause windows to break. It was

the loudest, most awful sound like it would start. I was a kid. It would startle me so bad every time

that, uh, they would fly. I think it was just F-16s or something, but they would break the

sound barrier like you knew it. Uh, so flying a supersonic commercial jet over anywhere, uh,

will cause that same sound barrier noise of this loud, like, crack going off that, um, breaks windows

and just is incredibly, uh, upsetting for everyone on the ground. You know, you don't even know when

it's gonna happen. You know, it's just all of a sudden there's this loud, like, crack of thunder

going off, uh, with no idea where it came from. So that was the biggest issue with supersonic flight

that I could see, and that was as a child. But, you know, going back to the Concorde being a

supersonic jet, uh, flying that thing over any sort of, uh, urban area would get so many complaints,

which is probably why it shut down in the first place. Um, I, uh, I'm going back. See, I have a lot

of experience in, uh, bars and nightlife. I know I'm not segwaying properly, but I have a lot of

experience in bars and nightlife just being in Vegas for so long. Going to nightclubs out there,

uh, and I can't remember all the names changed of the nightclubs I went out, went to out there.

Uh, so, you know, they were all the main, like, touristy, uh, nightclubs, and then we'd have our little

bars we'd go to. Sometimes we'd get hotel rooms. Like, I think we got the Rain Man Suite at Caesar's

Palace one time and, uh, went to the nightclub at Caesar's Palace. And that Rain Man Suite, you know,

it's a big hotel room. It, it, that was a memorable night just because we were going, we were drinking

up in the, in the Rain Man Suite and then going down to the nightclub and drinking down there.

So, uh, that was pretty good. So one of my friends got a discount on the thing and, uh,

we all, you know, we all chipped in 20 bucks or something and that paid for the room,

which was really good. So that was one of the nights, you know, I probably went to every

nightclub in that city at one point, uh, cause this did go on for 10 years. And because I don't

want to go back to Vegas for anything, you know, I don't want to be back there. Uh, it would,

it would pile onto me worse than it did the first time. So, and I lost everything the first time.

So I don't want a second tour of that. Um, so, uh, you know, using maybe some of that experience

we'll carry, carry over here to Austin and, uh, hopefully turn a profit, uh, because I got Oath

going, you know, I don't know how successful it's going to be yet, but I'm just going to keep

uploading on there and see what happens. It's still getting a few bucks in here and there.

Uh, the rush did, uh, uh, calm down, but the next step, you know, because I'm all modeled

out right now, uh, going to a nightclub, you know, would be a, a logical choice. And the only

nightclub that comes to mind that I even know about is that concourse project. But, uh, because

transportation is, is very difficult right now. Uh, you know, I don't, I don't have a way to go

over there very easily. So that's what I'm doing. I'm going to keep walking around just like, uh,

getting a little bit of exercise and calming down. Anyway. Thank you.

So yesterday was the first warm day in like a month.

And the night before, I couldn't sleep at all.

So I guess I slept most of the day and then couldn't sleep at night.

So I was up the whole night.

And then I decided, well, I'll ride the bike downtown.

So I rode the bicycle the whole way to Auditorium Shores.

And then rode all over downtown.

And went to that outdoor fitness area for like an hour or two and worked out.

And then rode the bike all around again.

And then took the bus back.

And fell asleep at like 7.

And woke up, I don't know.

The first time I looked at the clock, it was 11 p.m.

And then the second time it was 1.30.

And then 2.30. And then I gave up.

So now I'm back awake again.

I'm wondering if I just keep like jamming through that way.

I'll be able to sleep at night and be awake during the day.

Meaning I just take the bike out during the day.

And be far enough away from the hotel during the day.

To not be able to fall asleep.

And then show back up completely exhausted.

And then be able to sleep at night.

By completely forcing myself to sleep at night and not during the day.

I don't know if it's going to work or not.

That's my latest attempt at the sleepless nights thing.

I have an absolute ball at Auditorium Shores.

It's just a park with a fitness area, a bicycle path.

And the river is right next to it.

And you can see the whole skyline of Austin as a backdrop.

So it's just a very interesting place to be.

And I've been there a bunch of times before.

But because it's been cold for the past month, I haven't been able to get there for a month.

So it really cheered me up too.

I was so happy to be down there for the day.

Part of a luxury of not having much money to spend.

Is the smallest things become the most wonderful things.

Like just having a bicycle that works.

And being able to ride it the whole way down.

That's end all be all.

Because if one little thing breaks on it, you're just down.

And you don't have money to repair it.

So that's like a repair that doesn't cost much money.

Nothing costs much money.

But you're really happy the thing works.

And so for getting out of any sort of funk or depression.

Or any misery one may get themselves into.

Living with very little money, there are benefits to it.

Now I don't know. I've only sort of been on the wealthy side.

When I was in my 20s, I was making some money.

Like $100,000 to $120,000 a year.

But I was still kind of considered poor then too.

Even making that money.

So I had cash coming in, but then everything else was poor.

Like community, family, friends, social circles.

Resolving my parents' crimes over the course of 50 years.

I hadn't resolved that yet.

Until the police were considering me a criminal.

When I never actually was one.

I've never been arrested.

I've never received a citation more than a speeding ticket.

I've never had a DUI.

I only had one other citation.

That was when two dogs got out of my backyard.

They had out-of-state dog tags on them.

And I got a citation for that.

So it was just a few speeding tickets and those dog tag citations.

All in all, that's a pretty good record.

Considering everything I've been through.

Having a gigantic party face in Vegas.

And then being homeless for three years.

Or actually before being homeless.

Traveling around the entire United States.

First I lived in a Ford C-Max and then I lived in a Ford E350.

Just driving around the whole country.

Cruising around.

Then was homeless for a few years.

And now I have this hotel.

And have maintained no criminal history whatsoever.

So I'm working very hard to maintain that.

I'm not going to associate with any crime or intentionally commit a crime in any way.

That's where I am now.

Plus, I'm happy as can be just going to the park anyway.

That's all I really need.

The motive and intent is not there.

Anyway, I'm going to walk around a little tonight.

My legs are tired because that was so many miles on the bicycle.

I'm trying to build up my upper body strength more.

Mostly arms.

My arms are weak.

Everything else, I have chest.

Everything else is pretty good.

But my arms are weak.

So I'm trying to build up my arms at that outdoor fitness center.

And the only real exercise that seems to be able to help with them are pull-ups.

Nothing else really does arms except for pull-ups.

So I'm trying to do as many pull-ups as possible.

To get those big arms you see on guys everywhere.

Just to walk around and kind of half-brag about it.

Anyway, that's what I'm working on.

Thank you.

So I just got a yelling match a few hours ago

with one of the neighbors at the hotel I was staying at

because his dog was not on leash

and I rode the bicycle up the sidewalk

and the dog ran up to me and I tried to like shoo it away

and I told the owner, you know, can you call your dog back?

And then the dog started attacking.

So then I started yelling at the dog and then the owner

and then turned into a huge yelling match.

So I went, him and I went to the front desk

and I told them to call the police

because the dog tried to attack me

and he refused to put it on leash.

So I tried to stay at the hotel, but it was too much.

So now I went with money I made from Oaf.

I went down to a different hotel down the road

and I'm now staying here.

I just paid for one night.

We'll see how it goes.

I'm trying to switch hotels.

I've been trying to switch hotels for the past week

and hopefully find a good spot to live in Austin.

Anyway, thank you.

So I'm out walking around again. I slept most of the day. I'm at a different hotel now,

so I'm at a different spot. And like I said, I just got in that yelling match

over a guy not having a dog on a leash, and then the dog becoming aggressive,

me trying to shoot away with my foot, and then I started yelling about it. And so I

ended up moving for that reason. But now I'm thinking, you know, if I go through a couple

sessions of therapy to really tell him everything I went through and everything I've been through,

which is a lot, and ways to improve myself, I wouldn't be against that idea.

So I'm going around looking at therapists and seeing if that's in any way possible,

just to build up some trust, you know, so I can build up more trust in the community,

so people have more trust in me. And a simple way to do that is to just go get therapy and then tell

them everything, which is what I've been doing on this cell phone anyway, tell them everything,

and then get a sign off that I'm like coherent and sane and not a threat to anyone.

So that's what I'm thinking now. The biggest problem I'm having is transportation is difficult.

Now with the new hotel room, I'm farther away from the bus stop, and I'm trying to reduce how

much I'm riding a bicycle around. I was probably riding it around too much, which isn't helping.

I don't know if it upsets anyone riding a bicycle on the sidewalk all over the place,

but I switched to walking for the time being and I'm just using that to get exercise.

So my personal form of therapy is just get as much exercise as possible and then go to sleep

and try to talk everything, talk or yell everything I'm thinking to whatever, you know,

to whatever people, electronic device, or audience that wants to listen. So I'm still

working on everything, trying to get a new camera, which, you know, conveniently,

the camera I ordered, they delayed shipping. I had to switch hotels and now the previous

hotel said, well, we're not going to receive any packages after you check out. So that camera

might have gotten lost or just kind of vanished on me. So I'll try to get a refund and then get

another one. So I have a real camera because this has been going pretty well. I want to keep it

going to the best of my ability. So anyway, thank you.

So this is what I used to do all the time when I was homeless.

I was homeless for like three years and I've told this story before,

but I'd walk around like empty strip malls like this one and uh,

uh, kind of, you know,

I was so hopelessly addicted to cigarettes that I, you know,

would just buy leftover cigarettes and it's still kind of going off,

you know, uh, you know, I see them laying around.

I have vape on me now,

but what I'm really craving is just a normal piece of chewing gum.

So I've got it mostly clear, you know,

like mostly clean of whatever that addiction was.

I don't know if it was based on needing exercise and just wanting to be

outdoors or just, you know, your typical nicotine addiction.

But, uh, uh, now I'm just craving normal, regular gum.

So, uh, it's getting better. I'm still vaping a little, uh,

so it's not perfect, but you know, my going back to therapy,

my version of therapy is just exercise and then talking a lot or potentially

yelling a lot. Uh, so, um,

that's like my version of just clearing out whatever's in there. Uh,

and, uh, it's gotten me this far,

but it's so basic that it only gets so far,

you know, it doesn't,

it doesn't get to the more intricate levels of society.

So, uh, that's why I'm eyeing, you know,

seeing if I can get a therapist and also this solution to my sleepless nights of

walking around or getting a lot of exercise. Um,

there may be a better solution than this. Uh, I, uh, I,

I kind of find myself, you know, one of the few that's doing this.

So rather than, uh, everyone else being wrong,

it's probably me being wrong. Um, so that's why, you know,

if I get the chance,

I'll go speak to a therapist and figure out what the best like solutions for my

problems are. Um, on, on another thing,

this looks like the end for party city. They got, uh, uh,

everything closing down and, uh, everything's marked down.

Like, you know, it's one of these store closer closures. That's,

that's just so much fun to look at because you have like 80% discount on

everything. Uh, I went through one, uh, I worked for circuit city.

I quit before they closed,

but it went through a gigantic store closure where everything was 80% off and,

you know, you could get stuff for like 40 cents, uh,

which is really fun to browse around. I don't know, you know,

party city isn't the most exciting store closure, but, uh,

uh, it's still interesting to see the amount of discount you get when a store

closes. Uh, I, uh,

I can't imagine what treasures you could dig up out of there. I don't know,

you know, what kind of party you'd get going. I was thinking, uh,

discount party stuff, but there's, there's not much use for it.

So anyway, thank you.

So I came back out to this, uh, uh, it's not an outlet mall, you know,

it's just a regular outdoor shopping area, I guess. Uh,

came back out to this thing just to walk a little bit. Um,

I think part of the problem is during the day there's so many people everywhere

that I feel like I'm, I'm crowding them or they're crowding me or something.

So walking at night really alleviates that.

And I, uh,

I slept for a few hours today during the day and I remember thinking when I was

going to sleep that, uh, you know,

I should wait until the night and I'm like, Oh, just whatever. And went to sleep anyway.

So, uh, I don't know, maybe it's just a force of habit or,

uh, uh,

potentially walking around with this camera at night is more income.

Uh, because you know, I have such little money coming in. Uh, anything, you know,

anything that earns anything I'm willing to, well, within reason I should say,

um, that earns any money is, is good for me.

So walking around with a camera with two bright lights on it,

telling my story at night, uh, maybe it just makes more.

And that's why I'm like automatically going towards what earns more,

you know, what you need. It may not even be money.

It may be everything that, that builds a happy life.

So, uh, I'm going to keep walking around out here. I'm not,

uh, I'm not bringing the bicycle out. I don't know.

It's kind of taking a break from it. Uh,

it, uh, I don't know if it's causing more,

more like drama than, uh,

than just walking normally. So I, uh,

I'm going to continue going on here and try to upload any videos of anything

interesting that may occur. Anyway. Thank you.

So, after being out here so much, you know, before all of this,

I was raised way out in the middle of nowhere in both Nevada and Alaska, so it's extreme country,

and there was no one around anywhere. You know, it was just me and my parents.

And so, this is a completely, like, foreign, well, from my childhood, it's a foreign environment.

From, you know, I don't know, when I turned like 12 or something, we moved to the city,

and then I was surrounded by people. But from my early childhood, this would be a completely

foreign environment. And I was just going through, you know, saying I need therapy and all the

issues one can have that would require therapy, and one of those is being depressed. And I don't

know if I've ever been depressed or not, or considered depressed. Part of growing up with

very little is it takes very few things to make you happy, you know. The cheapest little thing can

just be the most entertaining thing. And, you know, you just got to kind of play around with it,

right? And it's the most entertaining thing. So, bringing up depression, like, if I start even

getting close to feeling sad or down or whatever, I end up just doing what I'm doing now. I'll just

go walk around or try to come up with some new idea that people would find entertaining.

That's what I'm doing right now, at least. I don't know if I would have ever even fallen

under the category of depressed. Part of what gets through that, you know, I've always been

kind of a thrill seeker, too. So, you know, motorcycles, sports cars, before it was airplanes,

although I got in a plane crash, so the airplane is out. But, motor sports cars, motorcycles,

bicycles. See, I was riding a bicycle, and that was a thrill in and of itself, just kind of

cruising along on the sidewalk through the city. So, those were ways to cheer myself up.

And part of just walking on the sidewalk at 3 a.m. does the same thing. You know,

you don't know what's going to happen or what's going to be out there or what you might see. So,

that motive or that, you know, reality is what makes it interesting. And that's why I'm walking

out here now. Stuck out at night, you know, I'm just, all I'm really doing is trying to figure

out what content to put on here and what to say about myself and what people want to see and

and how to improve my lifestyle and situation. And as it sits right now, because,

because, you know, I'm from the very rural part of Nevada that was surrounded by casinos and

brothels and everything low income, more, you know, the one thing I would want is just more

police everywhere. You know, that would better my life if there were just more police everywhere. So,

that's the, that's the one thing I can think of right now that's kind of holding me back

is there's just not enough police around. So, I probably work,

I don't know, it would be a different situation, but, you know, starting to feel comfortable

with total police presence everywhere would be better because I have no criminal history,

I've never broken the law. Well, I shouldn't say I've never broken the law. I've never

intentionally broken the law other than potentially maybe speeding. But

coming from low income housing, you know, my early childhood, and then I kind of climbed up a little

bit and fell back down to low income. So, the one void that's always been there throughout my life

is not having enough police around. It's been, it's a reoccurring kind of issue. It doesn't

matter where I go, it's always, I always end up in this kind of position. So, that's where I am.

I'm going to keep walking around tonight and hopefully come up with more stories to tell

into this thing. Anyway, thank you.

So I just got a new 4K camera. It's one of the small ones, but seems to be better. It

seems to have more features and should take higher resolution videos. I'm hoping it'll

be a little more stable with focus and photography. With the cell phone, I wasn't able to take

pictures at all. They would come out grainy and blurry and just kind of useless. So I'm

trying this out for content creation and making short movies and whatever else. I'm still

learning about the camera. I've had a few cameras before it, but they were way back

when digital SLRs first became a thing. So I don't have much experience with the new

one, so I have to kind of go through and relearn everything. But it seems to have pretty good

features on it and better resolution than the cell phone did. And hopefully more reliable

like focusing and image quality. So I'm going to keep learning about it and telling my life

story on here. Anyway, thank you.

So like I said, I switched hotels and now I'm at America's Best Value Inn, I think.

Anyway, they have a pool at this one, but it's not opening until April and it's too cold.

I was just going to sit out there a little bit, but they don't even want the pool area open.

When I lived in Vegas, I had a pool in my backyard and we used to have a lot of house parties.

I got good at maintaining pools from that thing. When I bought the house, the pool was just bare

concrete on the bottom and the filter was destroyed and there were a few problems with it.

So I ended up plastering the bottom and then pasting over it and then putting that latex

paint all over the bottom of the pool so it looked brand new. You know, it maybe cost

$1,000 in repairs and this was all done to a pool that the pool guy said was

completely destroyed. You'd never be able to get it working again.

I put maybe $1,000 into it, got it running pristine. It might have been $1,600

because I bought a sand filter to replace the cartridge filter, so it might have been $1,600 in total.

We partied in that pool for like seven years because my house was on a half acre

and there was plenty of room to park cars in the backyard and then just drink by the

pool in my backyard. I didn't have to worry about noise complaints because it was a really

slummy area, so that was a lot of fun. I'm still kind of drawn to pools. I went out and got

half a tan yesterday at the park, so my back is really tan, but my front is not at all.

So I look like one of those yin-yang symbols. I was gonna lay out here and even it out,

but they won't let me go in the pool area, so I'll sit upstairs and keep working on cameras.

Anyway, thank you.

So I'm at the Party City store closure and I walked around the whole thing.

They do have stuff for 40 cents here.

But the only thing I can find of any interest is some of the sports memorabilia

and me liking the Dallas Cowboys. You know,

I wish they had more Dallas Cowboys stuff.

There's just like a bag and whatever those playing card things are.

So there's not much else. They did have a few Halloween costumes.

This brings up another story. In Vegas,

the Halloween parties there are obnoxious.

So we would dress up every year and go to one nightclub or outdoor party or

whatever.

And I think this thing has a different definition of party,

but you know,

I feel for these store closures, I think I've said before,

I worked for Circuit City and it went through the same process of everything

marked down excessively. And then the whole thing just went under.

So I have never been in a Party City before,

so or at least I don't think so.

So I've been walking around here for about half an hour.

I asked him up front if I could record a clip just of the store closing and my

story about store closures in the past. And they said, yes, it's fine.

So I'm going to keep walking around here and see if any little treasure pops up

for 40 cents. Anyway, thank you.

So another story about Vegas.

I used to be big into these watches and I'm at a jewelry store now and they have

quite a few nice watches and I always liked Fossil.

You know, I just told them that Fossil was my favorite.

I think it's because like when you wear a Fossil watch,

it reminds you of like, you know,

like dinosaur fossils and stuff you dig up. So I really liked that.

But this old like jewelry-esque watches,

cause you know, everything went digital.

Those, those digital wristwatches. So because everything went digital,

these old ones are still really interesting to me and I'm glad they're still

around. Anyway, I'm trying to figure out what to do with TikTok now because its

future is so uncertain that I'm probably going to branch out to other brands.

Anyway, thank you.

So I've made my way out to the park again, and it's early. They're setting up a huge

concert or something at the actual park, so it's just the bike path that's open.

But I can still work out. I'm just working on arms. All day today is arms. My legs are way over,

and my arms are really weak. So I'm just working out arms with the pull-up bar over and over again.

But I'm sitting out here by the lake river thing, and in my past, I grew up on a cattle ranch

that we had two trout ponds, or maybe three trout ponds, that had a creek feeding them,

and all sorts of toads and frogs and wildlife all running around there. Bobcats, coyotes, deer,

I don't know what else, mountain lions, or cougars. Some people call them cougars.

We had all sorts of stuff like that running around there, so I got a lot of experience with wildlife

from that. But, you know, now being in the city all the time, I don't see wildlife that much anymore.

I actually prefer being, the reason I'm in the city in the first place, is I prefer being

away from the giant wildlife. Specifically in Alaska and Canada, the moose and the bear are

the worst. Like, you can't go outside. It's so unsafe because of bears and moose. You just have

to stay indoors the whole time, and I didn't like it very much. So I like being outside,

and it was funny, you know, being out in nature, I couldn't be outside, at least in Alaska and

Canada, because the wildlife was so bad you couldn't even be out there. You just have to

stay indoors. So it's much nicer in Austin. I really like it here. I'm gonna keep, you know,

I'm working on my arms and diet and exercise as much as possible to keep this going. I did a

little more research on what's going on with this event setup, and it turns out it's South by

Southwest, which is a big music event here in Austin. And the guy I asked, you know, there's

Sippin' Sounds, which is before South by Southwest, so I think that's part of the South by Southwest

music event. And I've been to it before. I was here, I may not have gone to any of the actual

concerts, but I lived in Austin during it, and this was like 10 years ago. And it was a big,

big event for all the bars downtown. This time, you know, because I'm just looking for footage,

I'm trying to get as much content as possible of, you know, the setup and the whole process.

I've worked as event staff before

for raw concerts, but it was for the university. And so I only had partial experience with these

outdoor ones, but ended up leaving because I had to clean up my parents' crime syndicate that they

had created before I was born. And I had to, you know, hire lawyers and explain how money was

received that my parents had somehow, and no one knew where they got it. So I was able to get through

all that. It took eight or nine years of constant explanation and syncing up with the rest of the

country, because the problem with situations like that is you end up out of sync with everyone else.

They end up hoarding a lot of money, and they don't work anywhere, so no one has an explanation

where they've been. There's no vouchers or alibis or anything. So that's what took so long. That's

what caused me to bog down so far, to the point now where I'm just about climbing out of it.

So that's most of my backstory that led to this situation. But because I picked up a

tablet and started recording myself, that's what started this whole thing.

So I'm just going to continue with this and see how it goes. I got 30 seconds of my weak little

pull-ups on the bars. I'll show the footage now. It's not very good, you know. I'm just

I'm just, like, barely starting out on arm exercises. So here it is.

So here's a short pan of the skyline behind me. Austin has a really pretty skyline. It looks

better from the park, but because it's closed down, you know, I can't really get footage of it.

Um, so this is it. They're building new skyscrapers, uh, constantly. So

I come down here all the time. This is like my my R&R, get exercise, clear my head spot.

And, uh, I have yet to be in any one of those skyscrapers. Someday. It hasn't happened yet.

Um, I know a few of them, like Google's back there and, uh, I think Indeed and,

and a bunch of hotels. So I guess I was in the Fairmont. Uh, I did get in the Fairmont. I went

up and looked at the pool in the Fairmont Hotel, um, because they have a very nice hotel pool,

but it's only open for guests. They don't have public parties with the thing, which is what I

was looking for. Um, back in the Vegas days, uh, we would go to pool parties all the time. I had

pool parties at my house. Then we would go to the hotel pool parties that were open for everyone.

Um, you just had to show local ID and, and you would get in and they would have gigantic pool

bars. I was hoping to get something like that going here, but it just hasn't happened yet.

Um, the, the opportunity is probably still available. A lot of people swim in the lake

behind me. I still think a pool is better than a lake. You know, it's just more fun. Plus you

can sit around and drink and talk to each other. Uh, whereas in the lake, you know, it's whatever.

So, uh, I'm going to keep, uh, uh, kind of scanning around for a pool until I find one.

Behind me is more footage of the setup process of this thing. Um, it looks like a pretty big

event. I don't know how many people are going to, uh, show up for the thing. They do it every year.

Um, I've been here for three years, but this is the first time I've physically been down,

uh, at the park for it. So, or for the setup, at least, um, I don't know, uh, what bands are

performing. I'm sure it's a million of them. They've probably got a million bands lined up,

which is probably available online. Uh, it's not until 7th, 8th, 9th. So today is like the

2nd or 3rd. Um, so it's a pretty extensive setup process for this thing. I'm going to try to come

down here and get footage of it, hopefully, uh, when it's going on. Because I use the bus to get

around, I don't have to worry about parking and I don't have to worry about, uh, uh, getting in

anyone's way as much. Uh, you know, it's really easy to just be really small. I'm just a guy

walking around with a camera. Um, so, uh, uh, that may be able to get my foot in the, you know,

in the area for the thing. I don't have much money, so I won't have money to actually pay

to get into anything, but may still be able to get some footage of it. Walking back from the park,

uh, it's a considerably longer walk, uh, than before, but, you know, there's, there's events

along the way. So, and it's good exercise. I've been sitting in that hotel room, so it's good

exercise to get out. I did, uh, uh, use the bus for most of that, most of the way, but it just

does not come anywhere near here. So, uh, it's a good size, uh, walk back. I'm gonna

throw this whole thing together and put it up there.

And this, this would be the first time I've ever, uh, edited, uh, multiple clips together. So,

I apologize for any, uh, sloppiness or, or poor work in the footage. Anyway, thank you!

Just came out again and walking around. I was in the hotel room for maybe an hour, hour and a half.

I edited that whole thing together, the entire 10-minute, 5-second video.

So I was out all morning working on that thing. And now I'm out at the

Target mall. Just went and had McDonald's and I'm going probably back to Target to

just kind of walk around the store in circles to half socialize and half see what I want to do

next. The last time I went through this I was in Vegas and I just got over the whole party

everything. And I first worked for Lowe's, then I worked for Office Depot, and then I worked for

Target. And when I started working for Target, I worked there for a couple months.

And I was leaning up against a counter and got fired for it. But there was no warning or any

write-up or anything. It was just, lean against the counter, you're fired. And I went back and I

think the boss, he one time said he thought I was after his job, like I was trying to take his job.

And I wasn't even thinking that at all. But after that, you know, I'd given up on Vegas entirely.

And I moved, that's why I moved up to Boise. And I started working as event staff for the

concerts. So that's the backstory on how I got to the concerts in Boise. And now I'm at Target

again. And am I in that same path of walking around Target for a while, and then kind of

socializing, kind of making myself look presentable, which is what to use that thing for. And then

kind of hustling down at Auditorium Shores, which is where I was all morning, to see if there's any

kind of paycheck down there. Because they're setting up this huge musical festival anyway.

So it might be possible to get the same kind of path going.

But we'll see. Because Oath is going pretty well. Well, at least it was, you know. Now it's kind of

just, well, but we'll see. If money keeps coming in from that, that's where I'll be.

You know, anywhere money's coming in from, that's where I'll be. So anyway, thank you.

Damn, it feels good to be a gangster. A real gangsta-ass nigga knows the play.

The real gangsta-ass niggas get the floss of the bitches, ask that gangsta-ass nigga Lil' J.

Them bitches look at gangsta-ass niggas like a stop sign and play the role of Little Miss Sweet.

But catch the bitch all alone, get the digits, take her out, and end up hittin' her ass with a meat.

Cause gangsta-ass niggas be the game players, and everything's quiet in the clique.

A gangsta-ass nigga pulls the trigger and his partner's in the posse, ain't tellin' off shit.

Real gangsta-ass niggas don't talk much. All you hear is the black from the gun blast.

And real gangsta-ass niggas don't run for shit, cause real gangsta-ass niggas can't run fast.

Now when you in the free world talkin' shit, you the shit, hit the pen and let a motherfucker shank ya.

But niggas like myself kick back and peep game, cause damn, it feels good to be a gangster.

Thanks for watching!

So I was able to get a gym membership,

and it's right across the street from here.

I went in there.

They ended up closing like half an hour after I got there,

so I didn't get to do the full gym experience,

but it was nice being able to go in there.

I used to go to the gym all the time.

Now I'm just doing arms.

You know, there's no reason not to just do arms all day,

every day until I have big arms to show on camera.

You know, that's like the sole motivation.

I know you're supposed to do full, complete exercises,

but now I'm just being so,

I guess immature would be the word to say about it,

that I'm just doing arms.

I've been able to do most of the other exercises,

you know, cardio and upper body,

majority of upper body with pushups and pull-ups,

and there's another exercise I do.

I can't remember the name of it,

but anyway, I've been able to do that so much

that, you know, just having free weights,

you know, it's instantly just start doing arms.

So that's what I did all night tonight.

You know, back in Vegas and Boise,

they had 24-hour gyms so I could go to the gym at night,

because once again, I'm stuck awake at night

and may not be able to sleep.

So I was gonna stay at the gym a lot longer,

but they closed.

So I'm gonna try to get my sleep cycle,

you know, as I've been doing,

try to get it set, you know, so I can sleep at night,

but it just hasn't happened yet.

I'm pretty happy it's so close

because I can just walk over there from here

and keep producing content on all three sites.

I posted more content, I don't know if it's still going.

We'll see how well it does.

I'm gonna keep trying to go with TikTok

as long as TikTok lasts,

because who knows what's going on with it.

And Instagram is rolling well.

So it's going, you know, I got a new camera

that I'm trying all this out on,

and we'll see how it goes.

Anyway, thank you.

So because I started an OAF account and now I'm pretty well committed to the thing,

because I'm well endowed, it just seemed like the the only direction to go. So now I'm like

trying to figure out how to make the thing successful and I have such a extensive past.

You know, it's dated now because I had to go on that eight year hiatus.

But it's dated now, you know, this was in my 20s and early 30s.

And as far as like all anyone wants to talk about is fetishes and kinks and all the stuff they're

into. And as for me, I don't even know what they were. You know, I would just think, you know,

some type of woman is attractive and then start like flirting or getting closer to that type of

woman until I got with one. And usually it was pretty stereotypical. You know, I went through

the whole goth girl phase and then and then I had to hit the brakes on the whole thing because it

was getting too dangerous. So I ended up just like anyone who is available on online dating,

I would just go out with and that's who I was with. And so that ended up being the curse of

the whole thing. At least during my whole party phase, because now I was picking up the bottom

of the barrel. And then I ended up becoming the bottom of the barrel from it. So and I didn't know

there there was any way out of it. You know, it's just that's the way it is. So having more people

to talk to would probably help because I kept this well-endowed thing a secret for so long.

I have to say it over and over again to make up for the backlog, even if it's just a mental backlog.

But, you know, hopefully start finding ways to talk to more people, explain my situation.

Anyway, going back to all this fetishes and stuff, I never really had much of anything

out of the normal stuff like. I think there were multiple times, but

the only one that ever captured my interest was

the whole one, maybe two system, which is, you know, you date one girl and then

her friend decides she wants to be there too and you don't like tell them otherwise.

I pulled it off once and it went pretty well, you know, went pretty well. It's not quite

a three-way, but, you know, it's pretty close. So that's as far as I ever took it. It

ends up, you know, wrecking havoc on any sort of relationship you're having

because now you can't trust anything, you know. The two of them start fighting with each other

over attention and you can't really trust either one of them because one wants the other and then

wants you then wants who knows what. So it's kind of, it's not for committed relationships,

that's for sure. But I only, there were a few times I pulled that off, but

I only got to certain levels with the second girl, I guess would be the way to describe it.

And that's about as far as I took it. Because the attractiveness of the women degraded

exponentially by the end of my, or end of the whole phase, you know,

the beginning of my 30s, early 30s, you know, it had dropped. I went from very attractive women

in my 20s, early 20s, to all the way down to the bottom of the barrel by my early 30s. And

that's why I just kind of gave up completely. I don't know, you know, how to prove that.

Uh, that's why I just gave up because I got so down and out after getting cheated on so many times

that, you know, it was just whoever wanted. And that's, that's as far as I was. So

I quit entirely and then that's when I started going on this crusade to

resolve all the crimes my parents committed. And now, you know, because I have that gym membership,

I'm kind of looking forward to going to the gym every day and I'll talk to people in there and

see what they say. Maybe there's other people's sordid past like mine that can relate to my

current situation of trying to make oaths successful while being completely straight.

You know, I'm a straight guy. I don't, I don't do anything with any other guys. So

uh, that's been another thing. There's a lot of

gay people on there. So, uh, trying to be courteous and not a tease and not like lead anyone on, but

I'm a straight guy. So I'm out walking tonight. I'll, uh,

probably try to go to the gym when it opens in the morning and finish the last of my arms

because I'm just going to try to work out arms the entire time

and see how big I can get my arms for no reason. Anyway, thank you.

So I'm at the the workout area at Auditorium Shores and it's early. You know I woke up at like 2 30,

couldn't fall back asleep, so I took the bicycle out and rode it the whole way down here. I don't

have a headlight anymore so it's just the taillight, but worked out a little bit and

they have gigantic sipping sounds all set up. So it's all lit up but there's no music or anything

so you can just see the lights blinking around on the thing. I used to work as event staff,

I know I said this before, but I used to work as event staff and now I'm like half in the gear of

the thing, but I've just been going to the gym and doing arms every day. So now I'm doing pull-ups

here and I go to the gym and I work out with the free weights to just get my arms as

big as possible for no reason, for absolutely no reason other than to have just as big of arms as

possible. I'm gonna roll back eventually, half the time I ride the bicycle downtown

and then ride the bus back. I may just ride the bicycle both ways. The new hotel is closer

to downtown which is nice, but it's not that much closer. You know it's like

a mile or two closer when it's 10 miles downtown, so it's still a good ride back.

I really enjoy it. When I first had my TikTok video go viral, the money I got from it,

I was gonna get an e-bike with the money, but first off they were expensive. Second,

I couldn't guarantee reliability of the thing. There was no way to know how long it was gonna

last and when my next paycheck was gonna come in to pay for it. And third, you don't get

the fitness out of it. This one I get all fitness out of, so I get in really good shape just riding

the bicycle around. So I'm pretty happy with my decision. It's still going strong. I haven't

had any flats, haven't needed any repairs, you know. I just kind of adjust the brakes and

gears and oil it up and it's good to go. So having a good time in Austin. I was

eyeing the Dallas Cowboys as a potential paycheck, but I have no way to go to Dallas.

You know, I'm completely stuck in Austin. So just staying here and working out until like some sort

of opportunity presents itself. Still working on Oath, but the money, you know, it was that

initial surge that made all the money and now it's kind of dried up. So we'll see if there's

any money available in adult entertainment. But yeah, I got through the initial like viral

tidal wave of switching straight from TikTok to adult entertainment and advertising on TikTok.

And then it just kind of went away. So we'll see. You know, I'm open to opportunities.

So they call her the Texas queen. All hail to the Texas queen. All hail to the Texas queen.

That's how we do it here in Austin, man.

I made my way over to the University of Texas at Austin

and before, you know, I went to college for two years. Well, all right. I went to

DeVry for two years and then community college for another two or three years

just for IT, networking, computer repair, all that stuff. So I went to college for that. That

whole thing kind of dried up on me. The part of the reason was probably partying too much in Vegas.

I was no longer able to be included with the rest of the nerds because after that much partying,

it kind of made me an outcast. So the whole thing kind of washed away.

I don't know because I've been doing this content creation, film production

thing for a few years now. I'd like to stay on this course, but don't know what to do.

I don't even know how to get my foot in the door in the school. What started, you know,

I bought that acoustic guitar at discount and it's still sitting there. I don't know how to play it.

They do have a music department here, but I don't even know where to start, where to get my foot in

the door or who to talk to or what to do. So the only name that's rattling around in my head

when I'm in the vicinity of this school is Glenn Powell. So I'm trying not to step

on Glenn Powell's toes by being here because, you know, he's a big movie star. I think he

went to college here or is going to college here. He did Twisters. I'm pretty sure his name

is from Lake Powell, Arizona, because there's Glen Canyon Dam at Lake Powell and then there's

Lake Powell. So Glen Canyon Dam is the dam that holds Lake Powell. So I'm assuming he got his name

from Lake Powell, Arizona. I've spent a lot of time at Lake Powell and I started thinking, you

know, what would my celebrity name be? And the biggest I could come up with was Joe Denali

because I spent some time at Denali National Park in Alaska and it's a considerably bigger

national park than Lake Powell, Arizona. So, you know, just if you're naming yourself after

national parks, going all the way to Denali would just win, you know, across the board. I don't think

there's a bigger, grander national park in the United States than Denali National Forest. So

I would have to put Denali in the name somewhere to hold that, but it sure would mop the floor

with Lake Powell, Arizona. But that said, you know, it keeps sounding Italian and, you know,

I did spend a lot of time in Las Vegas and there were a lot of Italians living in Las Vegas. Some

were my friends and, you know, I don't want to step on the Italian's toes either. So, you know,

picking a name that sounds Italian, that's why I'm still stuck with guy named Joe1 because I can't

come up with a better name. And this thing, you know, it's completely based on me having

identification while sitting on the side of the road in Florida. Because I had ID on me, I'm like,

well, I have a name. My name's Joe. So I just started, you know, that's where I came up with

guy named Joe in the first place. I don't know, you know, they have this big celebrity-like

process for getting a name. But the biggest, baddest I could come up with was Joe Denali on

my own. Just to use Denali National Park, and Denali Mountain is the biggest mountain in North

America. I don't know, it's like 20,000 feet or something. So it's considerably bigger than

any of the other mountain ranges in the United States. Also, my dad was a bush pilot in Alaska.

He never flew the mountain climbers to Denali, I don't think, but the pilots

take off at Talkeetna and land on Denali Mountain are in like the same circle as the bush pilots.

He would fly out in the bush, fly hunters out there, and they would hunt elk and

moose bear, you know, deer, caribou. So he was in a different kind of system. But I could still,

you know, potentially get some money out of that Denali National Park. Just, I lived in Wasilla

for a year, you know, I was driving around Denali all over the place. But there's only one main

road that goes anywhere near Denali National Forest, and the rest you can't drive on because

either it's too dangerous, there's too much wildlife, or there just isn't access because

everything washes out all the time from the spring flooding or whatever. So I'm going to walk around

the school today, see if I can put all this together into something useful, and maybe make

it to the next step. So I'm at the Apple Store Barton Springs, which is a long bicycle ride from

where I stay. I went all the way down from America's Best Value Inn near North Austin,

down to Auditorium Shores, to the workout area. Then I went back to the university,

talked about getting guitar lessons at the university, and then I rode the bicycle all

the way down to Barton Springs, which is a considerable ride with many hills in the way.

But anyway, I'm at the Apple Store now, and this iPhone 16's camera is a night and day difference.

To my Motorola, it's focusing. I don't know if it's going to hold that much better,

if it just does that well in the store. But this thing, you know, you can see the difference

instantly of that camera versus this Motorola. You know, I wish the Motorola would focus better.

I don't know if that iPhone is going to... See, I have weird low light situations and weird motion

in the background that the camera sometimes focuses on. So I was eyeing, you know, I just

asked them, some of these used old iPhones on eBay may have a better camera than this one,

because I'm still doing pretty well on social media that I use the cell phone camera for

instead of the main dedicated camera, because it fits in my pocket, and it doesn't have a lot of

settings to have to go through to just point the thing at myself and hit record. So I'm eyeing

the phones online, but I don't know if they're going to work, you know, in all the weird situations

I put this camera in. So I had a difficult time getting back downtown from that mall.

The way I took was on Google Maps, and it showed the bike path, but there was no bike path

whatsoever. It was like microscopic shoulder on the road. So I decided to take a different way back

and that put me on a highway of like speed limit 55, but it had a big shoulder, and it got me on

the actual bike path to come back. So I was able to come back much sooner, much less time than it

took to get down there. Barton Springs Mall is pretty nice. You know, I just went down there for

the Apple Store to look at the iPhone and to see it. You know, I'd never seen the other Apple Store

here. I'd been to the Domain one a few times, but I'd never been to that Barton Springs one.

Went down there, you know, got a soda and food court. That was it. Getting plenty of exercise. You know, the

exercise is helping with vape because, you know, I vape less when I exercise. So I'm trying to get

as much exercise as possible, and this bicycle is great for it. You know, it's just roll

around town, find clips to put on here, and kind of meet and greet people everywhere. So

that's what I'm doing. So I made it back down to Auditorium Shores, and you know, my sunburn is all

over the place. My back is burned completely, and my front is pale. So now I'm trying to burn

the front to even the tan out. It's impossible to get like a normal tan in the sun. So anyway,

the second time I've been recognized in person just happened. Here he is. What was your name

again? Jesse. Jesse. What's up, Joe? What's up, man? I want to see your TikTok. It's cool.

Run into you. Thank you. Thank you. Yeah, so he's the second person that recognized me,

and so I'm hoping for more. I'm down at Auditorium Shores as much as possible,

you know, as long as I don't get too sunburned. So anyway, thank you.

Just got back after making a 13 minute long clip and I slept for a few hours.

So it was, it was during the morning and early afternoon, but got back and received an email

that my Venmo account was frozen because they're requiring identification.

I only put like, I think half of my money in there, but still, you know, what, what happened

there? So it's frozen for seven days, which is kind of a pretty big roadblock.

Uh, I, uh, I don't know. I sent him an email with my ID and it's on Friday. I don't know if

that's seven business days, but it's a little disconcerting, you know, after transferring

my money over to Venmo, they froze the account. Uh, so I don't know, you know, I guess on Monday,

I'll give them a call and see, uh, what, what needs to be done to, uh, resolve it.

But, uh, uh, you know, a little warning before putting your money in there, uh, you know,

that if the, if the debit card is going to require identification, when you sign up for the card,

require identification. Don't wait till the customer puts a bunch of money in it and then

freeze the account requiring identification. So this is, this is my gripe for the day. Um,

I, uh, I hopefully will, we'll have enough to pull through for the next couple of weeks

without that money sitting there, but, uh, it's pretty irritating. So anyway, thank you.

So I'm a few beers deep, but I've been laughing hysterically.

I have been watching old clips of the

Nevada test site, nuclear testing.

And I know Reagan shut this down in

the, I can't remember, 1989 or something.

It shut down where they,

they were doing underground testing and

apparently the groundwater got too radioactive to continue.

So they had to stop nuclear testing.

In my opinion, I would have kept that going. I'm from Nevada.

I'm from the rural parts of Nevada where the groundwater would have been

radioactive. And I was never affected. I'm 42 years old now.

And I can't even get into the hospital is where I am.

I haven't yet had any ill effects from radioactive groundwater,

which I've consumed plenty of.

I think it was Amagosa Valley that had, you know,

they tested them and found some nuclear material in the groundwater.

I was more in Fish Lake Valley, dire Nevada,

which is a little farther North,

but still pretty close to where all that

testing was. In my opinion,

I would restart nuclear testing.

In the 1950s in Las Vegas,

you could sit at a hotel and look out and see a mushroom cloud.

Over the horizon from nuclear testing.

And I thought that was the coolest thing in the world to be able to see the

mushroom cloud over the horizon while drinking at the pool in Las Vegas.

So, you know, as far as money is concerned,

the way to make money is to just start blowing up those nukes

within viewing distance of Las Vegas and let everyone see the mushroom cloud.

So I was just watching clips of the old thing on YouTube and wishing I didn't

miss that whole thing. If I were in any sort of power,

I would reinstate nuclear testing both for nuclear power plants and nuclear

atomic bombs and let people watch the gigantic firework go off because that's

all it would really be.

I would have no intention of dropping this thing anywhere other than in central

rural Nevada just for a big audience to be able to view how much power one of

those things has and probably make some money from it.

That footage is still going strong now and it's from the 1950s.

So I think there's still plenty of money there.

But I don't know what legality is in the way.

I sure would green light the thing. Anyway, thank you.

So I'm out taking a walk. I was sitting in the hotel room. I'm still like daydreaming about hotel pools.

The pool at the hotel I'm staying at is closed and really small.

So I walked over. You know, it's funny. You're never more than walking distance

away from a Hilton. So there was a Hilton right here. I somehow got geared into the thing.

The only thing I can figure is that, you know, before when I lived in Las Vegas,

I worked security for the Mirage, which was a big hotel in Las Vegas. And in the 1970s and 1980s,

maybe 90s, the Flamingo Hotel across the street from the Mirage was owned by the Hiltons. And

they had this huge rivalry because the Mirage was the biggest hotel ever built at that time,

I think. And, you know, the Flamingo had been there for quite a while.

So the Flamingo Hilton was always the rival to the Mirage. And I don't know about how I feel

about Hilton hotels because there's always one and walking distance. I always think, you know,

it sure would be nice to let small businesses flourish. So, you know, having one big brand

hotel everywhere isn't ideal, but I'm sure they're nice hotels. You know, I like having

different owners for each place and not having these big corporate entities take over everywhere,

except Walmart. You know, I like Walmart. That's the only big corporate entity

I like being everywhere because it's still like independent owners selling there. That thing's

like a big swap meet anyway. So that said, I'm shopping at Target now because it's a little

more model-y. But anyway, going back to hotel pools, you know, in Vegas, they would have these

huge hotel pool parties where everyone could go to. In Austin, it seems to be a little more

locked down. Like they have apartments with pools and then hotels with pools. And the hotels,

you have to be a guest at the hotel to go to the pool. And at the apartments, I don't even know

what the rule is at the apartments. Can you just invite a bunch of people over? So I don't know.

There's probably some regulation on it that Vegas didn't have. That's why I'm used to having big

pool parties. And in Austin, you know, it just doesn't seem as reachable because I haven't been

able to find them. You know, maybe there's secret ones around everywhere, but I haven't been able

to find them. I am bound, you know, I have no transportation. I have a bicycle on my feet.

So I can't really explore the city that much. But getting my foot in the door in the adult

industry, the next step is just finding a pool somewhere and inviting everyone on there.

So anyway, thank you.

So I made my way out to a Rivian event. You know, I was down at the park and I was asking,

there was a security guarding off a spot off the bike trail and I asked, you know,

what's going on back there? Is there a pool? Uh, cause I just got pools on the brain. Anyway,

he said, no, it's a, uh, electric car, electric truck company, having a, filming a commercial

and then having an event. So I, I decided to see what electric truck it was. It turned out to be

Rivian. Um, which is, you know, I've seen them driving around, uh, all over Austin and, uh,

my personal preference, I prefer this one to the cyber truck. Um, the cyber truck doesn't

look like it's very useful. Uh, whereas I used to have a Nissan Frontier and this is roughly the

size of that Nissan Frontier I used to own. It's about the same size, only electric. Um, here's,

they let me sit in the thing. I said I would film and they said, Oh sure. Just sit in there and

film whatever you want. Touchscreen. So, um, here I am. It looks like it has a gigantic

map cluster on the thing. Um, that, uh, gives directions. The, uh, the screens in vehicles

have gotten bigger and bigger. Uh, I don't know. Um, what that is, you know, why, but people seem

to want bigger and bigger screens inside their vehicles. But this is a great little, uh, uh,

pickup, um, for what it is. I don't know anything about it. Um, I was just walking by and they said,

sure, go in there. So here I am. Uh, I don't even know if this instrument cluster, it may not even

be touch screen now that I'm touching it, but this is almost exactly the size of that Nissan

frontier. And I love that Nissan frontier. It's the size that really makes the truck. In my opinion,

here's the outside of the thing. Uh, I, uh, I'm trying not to record anyone without their, uh,

permission, but they got a tent on the back of it. And, uh, it's just a camping rig,

a little compartment pass through. Uh, so I've seen these before I've seen YouTube clips of them

and, uh, uh, have item because I've spent so many times, so much time outdoors. I've traveled all

over the country, uh, across Canada, all over Alaska. I've been to North slope, drove all the

way on the Dalton, uh, to North slope and, uh, on the Alcan through Canada, multiple times,

um, all over the United States, Montana, Idaho, Washington, Oregon, uh, California, Nevada,

Arizona, um, almost every state in the country, except for like Delaware. I don't think I've ever

been to Delaware. So, uh, I've been all over the country in a vehicle. Um, and this, you know,

I was, uh, I used to have a Chevy Silverado, uh, 2,500 HD Duramax, um, which was fun. You know,

it was a party in Las Vegas in that truck. But before that truck, I had this little Nissan

frontier and the Nissan frontier was the workhorse. Uh, the Silverado was just a party,

you know, it was, it was a crew cab, so we could all fit in there and we'd drive it down to the

Vegas strip and just have a party. So, uh, uh, you know, uh, I, I went to my high school reunion

and that thing and loaded, you know, uh, we, we had a huge party at the reunion and, uh, loaded

the bed full of people and drove all over the school in that Silverado, uh, with, you know,

it was just a party. It was never very useful. Um, whereas the frontier was actually useful.

So, uh, uh, looking at this Rivian, you know, the size, what, what size do you need a truck to be

to still be useful? Um, and so that's what I'm going through now. You know, I don't have money

for anything, but I was, I was going through, you know, how much bed capacity do you need? How much

towing capacity do you need? Because the frontier I think was, uh, I don't know, eight or 9,000

pounds towing. I very rarely towed with it. Uh, whereas the, it might've been 6,000 pounds. Uh,

the Silverado was 16,000 pounds, so it could, it could tow considerably more, but there was

nothing you needed to tow that was 16,000 pounds. I ended up getting this gigantic fifth wheel for

it just to rationalize the thing. And I just started dragging this fifth wheel around everywhere

just to prove that I needed the truck, you know, when I may have just been able to stick with the

small truck and get everything done with it. And usually with a small truck, you know, I,

I just use it to haul trash to the landfill and, and, uh, kind of four by four off road

with dirt bikes in the back of it, um, all over Nevada. So, uh, this Caribbean is pretty cool

though. So I got a little bit of the bed of this thing. Uh, the crowd cleared out. I can

actually film it. Uh, they had a little food exhibit, uh, which we had to wait on, but they

have a little cooktop and, uh, uh, area for preparing food. Now you can see how big the bed

is. You know, it's, it may not be the longest bed. You know, I always think how can you fit

a dirt bike in the back of it is always my, uh, my assessment of bed length. And this,

this is one where even diagonally you would have to put the tailgate down, but they do have this

mount for this tent on top. So it wouldn't be good for camping. Uh, I, uh, I don't know, uh,

what the ideal bed length is. You know, I guess it depends on your purpose. The, uh, back in the,

the olden days, you could get these little trucks with long beds, uh,

uh, long beds. So they would be like six feet. I think this one,

I don't think you can get these in a long bed though. And the long bed was always the more

useful, at least when I was out on ranches and stuff, you know, you wanted the long bed pickup

because it could haul considerably more. I don't know if that carries over to electric trucks that

much, uh, because you know, our, the ranch I grew up on was off grid. So I don't know the

poor solar panels trying to charge an electric vehicle on them would be difficult. So anyway,

thank you.

So I'm walking along again. I slept for a few hours during the day and now I can't

get back to sleep. I got noisy neighbors at the hotel and I can't find a place to

stay. I think I've been there too long already. This is just a nightly hotel. I'm

paying the weekly rate. I'm getting $3.23 in per week for rent but I don't know, I

don't have a place to stay. I can't stay in that nightly hotel forever and I

don't have good transportation to go anywhere. I just have the bicycle. So

this is becoming a more pressing issue. I was looking for shared rooms and

shared housing anywhere but I haven't been able to find anything that's cheap

enough and close enough to downtown that works. So now I'm just out walking around.

The, I'm walking by Ford right now. The last car I had was a Ford and it, I was

always getting spooked around in it so I couldn't stop driving around. I ended up

driving around in circles. I do the same thing on foot by the way. So you know, if

I'm on foot, I'll either get jolted or or something and have to move

around to get out of the way of whatever invisible phobia I'm avoiding.

And so I was having that trouble with the van. Driving all over the country,

just kind of bouncing around and using cardboard to make money and then filling

the gas tank. But when the tags expired in Florida, I ended up parking at a

McDonald's and got towed. And now I'm just walking by this Ford dealership.

Wondering if I could just driven it into Ford and gotten like 500 bucks or

something. But at the time, you know, I, that wasn't an option. It was just try to

get the thing to stop the momentum and then inform the police of my entire

situation was all that was on my mind. And I did all of that but still led to

me being homeless for years because I informed the police and got no response.

So more recently, you know, I just tried Las Vegas Police Department and Austin

Police Department and I tried multiple attorneys to settle my parents estate

because no matter what you do in Nevada, everyone takes the woman's side. So it

doesn't matter who's right or who's wrong or what anyone did. It's just

everything goes to whoever the woman is and you run the guy off. So that's

how the whole state seems to operate. And that's why I left. And that's why I

can't win the case despite trying multiple attorneys and having the law on

my side to the best of my knowledge. It's pretty considerable string of fraud she

did over the course of like 30 years to weasel all that money out of an ex-husband.

So I did my best to tell the attorneys that but I can't get a call

back from a lawyer for anything. You know, it just won't, they won't call back. So I

don't know what to do about that. I keep trying to dig up this mess because you

know the first thing that goes through my mind is you think, well everyone's

gonna think if I let them get away with that, you know, I'm just paying thieves.

Which is what happened, what pretty much happened in Nevada is I just start

giving away everything to thieves, you know, I couldn't stop it. And my mom

joined forces with them and then, you know, it was just a tidal wave of

everything I owned disappearing. So now I'm walking through Austin in the middle

of the night because I can't sleep, I don't have a place to stay, and I'm only

getting, not getting as much money from OFA as I was before. So hopefully it

catches on its own. I'm getting that $323,000 and I think I have $1,500 maybe $1,800

saved up. So looking for a place to stay. I don't have enough for a car so I'm

stuck on the bicycle. And the money that just went into this hotel was gonna be

for a car, but because I got run off by a guy with a dog who, I informed the police

about that too and it's just never on my side, you know, it's always, despite being

attacked by the dog, you know, I called the police, went, told the front desk, went

through the full process, and I had to leave. You know, I had to switch hotels. So

it's always that, you know, despite being completely on the legal side of things,

it's always me that has to leave. So now I'm looking for another place. If anyone in

Austin knows a good cheap monthly hotel, let me know on here. Anyway, thank you.

So I made my way to another bar just to check it out. It's called Barflies or the Golden Horn or something like that.

They have one pool table in here and it's quiet right now because it's mid-afternoon.

I walked over so I just got a glass of water.

I'm looking at different monthly hotels, apartments around this area.

I was looking near Busty's too but it didn't look like there were any hotels or apartments in my price range near Busty's.

So I'm trying this Barfly's side and seeing what's over here.

I wish I could get closer to downtown. I really like Auditorium Shores.

The whole downtown bicycle path, everything down there is incredible.

Like I've said before, I'm from the extreme rural country so just having that big of a city is awesome.

So I wish I could get closer to downtown but I can't find anything anywhere near my price range short of six miles away.

So I'm going to keep looking around here.

Anyway, thank you.

So I've been thinking about, you know, like what keeps me going and how I, uh,

stay positive and all of that stuff. And all my past, you know,

said before I, uh,

had a party in Vegas that may have gotten a little too big by the end of it.

That's why I had to bail and, uh, you know, slept around and all of that.

So, you know, like what motivates me and what, what keeps me going.

And just marrying a hot wife, uh, is,

is a pretty good size motivation. Now, before, you know,

I was just doing mid range. I had a few hot ex girlfriends,

but most were mid range. You know, and by the end it was the low range of the

bracket. So, uh, uh, that's why I just stopped entirely.

But, uh, uh, I started getting motivated. You know,

when I turned 30 I was like, man, I should,

I should start thinking about marriage and getting married. I'm 42 now.

It's taken this long to clean up the gigantic,

uh, mess I was in, um,

that involved Nevada brothels,

Nevada casinos and all sorts of like mob

activity. Um, all the, uh,

all the nightlife and gambling in Las Vegas and all of that

combined, uh, got in the way of me getting married.

So it took, it has taken 12 years so far for me

to, uh, uh, clean that up.

And I don't know how much longer it's going to take.

I've never been married before. And, uh, I'm like, you know,

that's something to try that I've never done is, you know, just get married.

And, uh,

so everything I'm doing now is like trying to head in that direction.

I know both seems like the opposite, but it, it seems like, you know,

I was looking at, at, um, uh,

adults and teenagers and a lot of them get married,

like right when they turn 18 years old, they're like 18, they're married. Uh,

so, uh, it seemed like it would go faster that way than any other

way. So that was one of my motivations for Oath.

And I'm going to keep just promoting myself here.

I'm working out at the gym as much as possible. Um,

I'm trying to eat healthy, be healthy, um, do everything social,

as social as possible to be able to pull off the simple motivation of

marrying a hot wife. So anyway, thank you.

So third time I've been recognized in public. I was, uh,

I'm trying to migrate down to the South Park Meadows area of Austin, um,

to see what apartments are available down there. Cause I'm spending like,

I don't know, 1,500 a month per, um, month at the hotel.

I'm staying in and it's 800 a month in a regular apartment.

So I'm looking at them down there. Anyway, uh, third time I've been recognized.

Jacob. It's nice to meet y'all. So there's Jacob.

He saw me getting off the bus and, uh, walked over and waved to me.

So I made my way to a new apartment that I'm probably gonna move in on Thursday

and now I'm just kind of touring around the neighborhood around it and they have

some really nice e-bikes at the store. Uh, this Schwinn, uh,

e-bike is the cheapest I've seen and it's 800 bucks.

I'm still riding around on that, um, uh,

Ozark trail, completely basic bicycle.

Uh, and you know,

part of the reason I got that one is the only e-bike I could find in that circle

was $800 the same as the Schwinn, but it didn't look very good.

Like it didn't look like it was going to last very long.

So these Schwinn's are much better. But, uh,

the problem I was having with the e-bike is, you know,

I'm more concerned about locking it up because I think someone's gonna run off

with their run off of the battery or, or, uh, start taking parts off of it.

And, uh, hauling it around on the bus.

I don't know how well it does in the bus racks.

I don't see e-bikes on those bus racks very often. So, uh,

that's why I went with the basic bicycle. But these,

these Schwinn's are the nicest I've seen. Um,

it sure would be fun to kind of cruise around on one of them. Although, you know,

I still need the bus here and there, uh, to,

to get to the actual destination I need to be at and not have to dodge traffic

the entire way.

Got something going on behind me. I can't figure out what it is.

I asked a few people and I yell, I'm so far away. I don't know.

There's like a few girls in the middle and then like a thousand guys around

circling all taking pictures. So I figured it's someone back there,

but who knows who or what it is.

So I just figured out who's in the center of that. It's big X, the plug.

I'll have to look him up, but here he is taking pictures.

What's up? Yeah. You want to be on there? There you go, man.

So yeah, I'm just looking.

Yeah.

Anyway. Yeah. I'm in the center of the crowd trying to figure out what's going

on. So, uh, I'm going to keep her recording footage on six and see what's

happening. So I made it down to this arcade bar. I can't remember the name of it,

but they have this old Mortal Kombat three here and uh,

on Sunday and Monday nights, it's free.

I came down here on one of those two and was able to play this thing for free.

But, uh, tonight's not, I'm not so lucky. I didn't know.

I thought it was free every night. Uh,

so I used to play this all the time when I was a kid. Um, wasn't the best,

you know, wasn't the worst, but, uh, uh, really enjoyed it.

I've built it here before, but the last time it was completely empty.

So I'm just trying to get as many clips as possible.

Uh, there's a lot of acoustic guitars in this city.

I'm still trying to learn mine. I haven't gotten there yet.

I am talking to the university.

They have a underground training program where the

undergrads teach people how to play instruments and uh,

they want like $200 an hour or something. So it was way out of my budget,

but it would be cool to know how to play the guitar.

Made it to another bar. They have a singer on this one too.

I know you always wanted to come around here.

But man I'm scared, I've been waiting for me.

I feel sorry for you cause you're coming to me.

So tonight I'm gonna give it my all.

Show you how I'm gonna live my life.

Pretty uh, pretty good night out tonight.

I'm bringing a backpack with me everywhere that's full of camera equipment.

And it's getting close, but I'm still getting through.

So they seem to like all the promotion and I like promoting my channel.

So it's a win-win.

So I'm headed back and it was a pretty eventful night.

I only went out to check out this new apartment

that I'm probably gonna move into. And I ended up downtown like always.

Went to a few bars. Didn't spend any money.

I've just been filming all night drinking water.

I got one drink from 7-Eleven and that was it.

So just like promoting myself and promoting everyone that seems cool around me.

And trying to get as much footage as possible. So thank you.

O, my feeling, coming back again

Like a rolling thunder, chasing the wind

Horses spooling from the center of the earth again

I can feel it

I can feel it

O, my feeling, coming back again

Like a rolling thunder, chasing the wind

Horses spooling from the center of the earth again

I can feel it

I can feel it

I can feel it

So I'm in Las Vegas now. I made it to McCarran Airport.

And I haven't left the airport yet because I have such a nice guitar, I can't get on the bus.

It was just a Guitar Center $300 one that had damage on the back of it.

That's completely in tune. I had the hard case and the shoulder straps for it.

So it's the complete guitar. I don't know how to play it.

But it's got me stuck now. I'm like bound by the guitar.

Because now I can't go anywhere because the guitar is too much.

So I'm sitting at the airport trying to figure out what to do.

I haven't been in Vegas in a while.

It was all of a three hour flight over here. It wasn't nearly as long as I would have expected.

But I got the win this morning after failing to get into that apartment in Austin.

Sitting at the bus stop in Austin trying to figure out what to do.

Just a plane ticket back to Vegas where cheap hotel rooms are.

Seemed to be the best idea.

So this is where I am. I'm stuck at the airport until I find some kind of transportation to get to a cheap hotel.

Made it down to Fremont Street. I went through a police investigation, paramedics, and a

psych evaluation. Got through all three of them, but made no progress. Now I'm just stuck

on Fremont Street. I don't know what to do. I was looking for a cheap hotel room. I can't

find one, so I'm just sitting down here. It's open to sit in one of those circles, but you

have to reserve it before actually going to stand there. So, I didn't reserve one prior,

and I don't know where the booth is. Carrying too much baggage around. I have been awake

for a long time, but don't even, can't even think about sleeping. You know, just trying

to get through all this.

So, like I said before, I'm in Vegas now and trying to sort out, you know, everything my

parents got themselves into. I'm trying to get an attorney to handle the estate and also I'm

still posting content on Oath, so that's still going pretty strong. I finally found a place

with a pool in Austin. I was having a terrible time with a functioning pool, but this one works.

This has got to be my favorite hotel in the world. It's got a pool and a jacuzzi

and the thing's empty for some reason. It's like 80 degrees outside right now. I'm about to hop in

that thing and swim for a while just to enjoy the pool scene. I prefer the pool to the beach.

I don't know what it is. I can't get the beach to work as well. The pool is always more fun. It's

more comfortable. It's right here, you know, you don't have to go anywhere. This hotel is in

the same neighborhood that my house was in Las Vegas that I used to have huge pool parties at.

Now, the pool parties I had at my house, we would all chip in and buy a keg and then I'd have a keg

at the house. I'd get UFC pay-per-view and have like 50 people over and we'd all

drink and swim all night. It was quite a bit of fun, but I don't know if I was violating any

laws or regulations. This is a safer way to do that, although they don't allow alcohol at the

pool, at this one at least. I'm going through all of that. I think the only

criminal anything that would have happened at that house when we were out there partying

was maybe noise violation. We had music playing pretty loud sometimes,

but I never got a complaint. No one ever complained. I never had the police come to the house

and I had pretty good-sized parties there. So, this being right down the street and a hotel

with a bigger pool, I wish I could get some of that going at this spot. You know, with Oaf going

and TikTok and Instagram, all three of them, getting a few people to the pool would be fun.

Now, I looked at the regulations at this hotel and I'm only allowed to bring two guests to the pool,

so it has to be one resident and two guests. The maximum is two guests.

So, the big 50 people idea is out, but it sure would be fun.

So the pool was too cold, but the, uh, the jacuzzi is just right.

I had to spend a night, uh, outside, um,

waiting for this hotel room. So I sat out front all night and it got,

you know, maybe 45 degrees, but it felt a lot colder. Um,

so I think I still have a little bit of that bone chill from sitting out there

and, uh, the pool, you know, I just wasn't ready for more cold.

So, uh, the jacuzzi is warm. That house I had just north of here, um,

when I bought it,

it had a defunct pool and a completely, uh,

non-functional jacuzzi. Um,

I ended up ripping the jacuzzi out and just keeping the pool.

And I had a solar heater on it and I would put the, uh,

cover on it to keep it warm.

So it would get warm way sooner than the rest of the non-heated pools.

Um, but jacuzzi is nice. You know,

jacuzzi with the right heater is a nice place to be.

So it's a shame they don't allow alcohol here.

I probably would have had a beer or two. Um,

but I'm waiting until Monday and I'm going to call the attorneys on Monday and

start that whole process.

So I decided to make a short clip of the hotel room I got, or hotel suite. I guess this would

count as a suite. Got the laptop and computer set up, or laptop and camera set up. And this

is the full, I guess, living room area. And then it has a bedroom. So it's a considerably

bigger hotel room suite than the last place was. And I think it's $400 a week for this

one, whereas the other one was $460 per week. And that's just for the first month. After

the first month, it goes down to $314 per week. So it's a much better deal. I'm in the

Las Vegas. And the other benefit to this one is it has not one, but two pools. This is

the second pool. I got footage of the first one yesterday. But there's the jacuzzi and

then the full pool area. There's no one at this one either, so I don't know what's going

on. It's only me that seems to want the pool. I'm pretty happy to have a place to sit outside

that's pleasant. Like I said before, this thing is really cheap. It's cheaper than anything.

This is the cheapest hotel that I know of. And it's a full suite, and you have two pools

to go to. So it's my favorite. Budget Suites was my favorite before and still remains my

favorite. The guy who built this thing has lived in Vegas for a long time. His name,

I think it's Robert Bigelow. I can't remember his first name. It might be something else.

But he had an aerospace company that they were building inflatable habitats for low-Earth

orbit. And last I heard, it shut down. I don't know if they're going to try to reopen it

or what, but I always thought Vegas was a good place to research space endeavors because

if you go out in the desert anywhere here, it reminds you of Mars. So it automatically

points whatever spaceship you're building to Mars, which I think is the only place to

go. Anything else is kind of a waste of time. Just get to Mars and start building that.

It would be the least waste of resources possible, in my opinion. I know people are going to

argue about everything. But in my opinion, just going straight to Mars is the place to

be. So having Vegas so similar to Mars, it just automatically points whatever. The influence

of the desert surroundings of Nevada kind of point whatever spaceship to Mars. So I

thought it was a good place to research spacecraft. Plus you have the whole party scene downtown

to cool off. So I'll be sitting at the pool today and just trying to come up with footage.

I'm waiting until tomorrow to call those attorneys and start the whole lawyer process. But as

for today, I finally get a day to just relax and calm down.

So it's been a while since I was here.

This was a casino that I used to go to quite a bit and there was the Texas

station right next to it.

This was the Fiesta that appears to be completely torn down except for the

parking garage.

And I think the Texas station was back there or something. But like I said,

I've been gone for 12 years or 10 years.

Um, so, uh, you know, probably a lot has changed.

I don't have transportation other than the city bus.

So I'm stuck at the hotel room,

but I haven't been downtown to see like the sphere and the, uh,

all the new resorts world. I don't think I've ever seen resorts world before.

So, uh, I haven't been able to go down there yet. But, uh,

if you know, I haven't, I haven't braved the city bus here yet.

I can, um, I know the guitar.

See, I was going to go downtown with the guitar and just sit there and, um, uh,

see what, what to make of it. But, uh,

the guitar is too much for the city bus here.

Like it will not be taking any trips on the bus. Um,

it's going to have to stay in the hotel room until I get an actual ride, uh,

around, which I just don't have yet. Um,

I'm going to try these attorneys tomorrow. Hopefully it pans out. You know, I,

uh, I, this is my old square. You know,

I'm a little South of where that house was.

It was maybe two or three miles North of here, but, uh, the same old square.

So I found myself getting comfortable really easy cause it's all like the same

system it was before. So, uh,

I'm trying not to start the downward spiral.

I got myself into the first time and, uh, you know,

seeing what's a safe and reasonable, um,

to enjoy a Las Vegas cause I am from Nevada.

So I have the from Nevada boost being here,

but I'm from Winnemucca, Nevada and Winnemucca at least the last time I was in

Winnemucca, they didn't like Vegas very much. I, uh,

I have spent most of my life trying to get them to lighten up about it. Um,

because, uh, it's a big moneymaker at the end of the day,

Vegas makes all the money. Winnemucca doesn't make anything. You know,

they dig up gold once in a while. Uh, but, uh,

Vegas makes the actual cash.

I've been thinking about how to continue. My past in Nevada is extensive.

Like I said before, I'm from Winnemucca. It was a cattle ranch about an hour and a half drive

south of Winnemucca in the mountains. We had 15 cows and three trout ponds.

Then we'd hunt deer and have gardens. There were a bunch of greenhouses out there.

So that was my childhood. I just spent the weekends out there. But part of that

tension between Winnemucca and Vegas is, I think because I was spending so much time in Vegas,

that's what caused that ranch to get traded into different owners before I took possession.

I don't know if it's worthwhile in the first place. It's way out there. The road washes out

a lot. It's extremely difficult to get cows running on the land. You have to truck hay out for them.

I don't think there's enough grassland on the property for them to just graze.

It's off-grid. Those were the many issues with the property. But as far as a fantasy goes,

you know like people that want to dream of living off-grid on a self-sustained

property, it was really good for it. You could get that thing like 90-95% self-sustained where

you had your own food out there, had your own water. Now the water was another weird thing.

It didn't have a normal well. It just had a pipe jammed in a creek in the mountains.

And in the winter you could drink the water out of the tap, but in the summer you couldn't because

there was too much bacteria in the water. So you had to then truck out water to drink

during the summer months, which wasn't the best. That wasn't the most ideal way to

to maintain a self-sustained property. So it worked for like 10 years or so. I think when

I was growing up it lasted about 10 years and then started giving out. It was hard keeping

cows going on it. My dad lived out there by himself for a while and I don't think he had

cows at all by the end of it. I had to pry him out of that hole. He had a house in

Winnemucca and that ranch and I had to pry him out of that and put him in an Alzheimer's care

facility because he was unable to continue driving. And that's what dug up this whole

mess they buried out there. And that started 10 years ago, maybe 14 years ago,

and it still hasn't quite concluded. So I'm cleaning up everything. I want to continue

investing in Las Vegas where I am now. It seems to pay off. I was just watching clips of that sphere,

the giant ball that lights up and has all sorts of different videos running on it.

I don't even know if videos does it justice, but they had DJ concerts in there and it looked

really good. So continuing investing in Las Vegas is what paid the first time.

But because I wasn't very motivated to get married when I was here when I was like 28, 29, 30,

that caused the whole thing to downward spiral. Just sleeping around and having parties and

doing all that. So I'm trying to avoid the downward spiral. I got myself in the first time

and now I'd much prefer, because I'm 42, I'd much prefer to just lock into a marriage and be done

with it and not have to play the field so to speak. But that hasn't happened yet. I'm still

not making enough money. I still have to hire attorneys to clean up the last of this estate

that that ranch is included in. So I'm sitting in Vegas now. I'm looking at film production.

They're trying to make a film studio in Summerlin where I used to work. I used to work for three

different golf courses out there. And Red Rock Country Club, Arroyo Country Club and

Siena Golf Course. Those were the three and they're right next to where they want to build

this film studio. So I may still have some connections out there. I don't think I really

burned any bridges. I kind of ran out of gas working the job just because it was IT. I was

on call 24-7. I did it for like six, seven years. So I was trying, you know, I thought at the time

and maybe I was just being overconfident that I could advance to the next level. And I did for a

short time, started working for hospitals, making more money doing IT, but then the whole thing just

kind of crashed down. So I don't know if I still have any connections out there. I didn't really

upset anyone. You know, I've never been arrested. It's very rare for me to, you know, cause a

problem for anyone. So I don't think I caused any issues in Summerlin the entire time I was working

there. And it was where the money was the first time. I was making all the money in Summerlin.

You know, I had a few other sites I would go out to and they would pay some and they were

all over the city, kind of sporadic, but the main one was the Summerlin golf course contract.

And that's what paid most of the money. So, uh, I don't know, you know, because I've been doing this

content creation for so long, um, that's gotten like halfway into film production. Although, you

know, working together, I need to know what my, my, uh, job title would be and, and how to get my foot

in the door and how to like, uh, write a script on the story I have from Las Vegas from 10 years ago

and what I can remember from that story. So that's everything I'm doing today.

So people online found cheaper places to stay in Vegas that are month-to-month,

and this one you can pay weekly, every two weeks, or monthly. So I looked at them,

but the problem is I would need to take out a bank loan to pay the month-to-month.

I have this thing set, you know, it's $3.14 per week, and I'm getting $3.50 per week plus,

tick-tock, oaf, money from that. So it never quite gets high enough to,

I never have enough cash in my account to pay the upfront $900.

So I guess I'm in some loan gear, I don't know. I don't have any credit cards, and I don't have

any loans of any kind. So it's all zero, you know. I'm cash flow positive, it's just very little cash.

I don't know what the best decision to make is. Because I've lived in this neighborhood for so

long, it's really comfortable for me to be here. But if it's not right, like I'm having trouble

getting an attorney through, which is the big hold-up. So I don't know, if I live in this

So I don't know, if I live in that different apartment, would legal aid be more accessible?

So that's what I'm going through now. Because my house was so close to here, this hotel room

is extremely similar to that house. It's just a hotel room, but you know, like, how you think in

the place is the same. So it's really easy for me to be here, because I've lived in that house for

so long. If I move to one of these others, I'm in a different neighborhood. You know,

there's a lot of familiar people here that I knew from 10 years ago. Whereas, you know,

if I move to a different one, then it's all different people. So I don't really know what to

do. This, I can stay afloat in this place as it sits. But I don't know if I'm supposed to be.

Before, I never told anyone I was well-endowed and I wasn't doing adult entertainment. So

I don't know if that puts me in a different system and I'm supposed to be in a different

part of town. Before, I was doing IT for those golf courses, like I said. And the whole thing

kind of blew up on me and caved in. And you know, going through the debris of the thing,

um, that's got me thinking, you know, what, what was everything that went wrong?

And one of the things, you know, what you think is I just wasn't being honest enough.

And the only secret I had was being well-endowed, you know, nothing else was a secret.

So I don't know if that caused the whole thing to implode. Or if, if, you know, my parents'

involvement in everything, uh, caused the whole thing to implode. Um, so I want to avoid another

implosion like that one. Um, and if living in a different part of Vegas with a cheaper, uh,

apartment hotel rental, uh, would avert that implosion, I would probably go that way.

And also being able to have, um, attorneys that, that I can actually use would be nice.

So that's what I'm going through today.

So I've been going through places to live and what to do and how much money I'm earning,

and I am still uploading content on Oaf, so be sure to check that out. Hopefully make

some purchases. You know, it's making money that way. But, you know, I've been thinking

about the whole adult entertainment industry in Las Vegas and how, you know, there's been

little studios that have started up that's never really taken off. I don't know what's

gotten in the way of it. It might have just been drifting around. You know, most of the

adult entertainers end up drifting around a lot, and I don't know if that goes against

like the Vegas kind of core, but there's got to be a way to get it working successfully

in this city. It seems like the right place for it. You know, and part of the reason I

moved back over here was Oaf started succeeding, so I'm like, I'll just go down that course

and see what happens. So here I am in Vegas because, you know, you don't have to worry

about taboo as much here as other cities. So it seems like the right place for it, but

it's paying some. You know, I don't know if that puts me on a different path from what

I was before. Before, you know, I was doing IT and just partying on the strip, and that

was pretty much what I was doing. So if that puts me on a different course, you know, I'm

just trying to scavenge from the last operation I had out here to see what works now. And

this pool, you know, because I had a house with a pool, we had big house parties, and,

you know, there were a lot of people in the pool, had a lot of fun. But we had music playing,

I don't know, you know, I'd have movies at a projector with a screen, and you could watch

movies in the pool from the projector. So that was quite a bit of fun. Now, looking

at this pool and how empty it is and how big it is, and there's two of them at this hotel

that appears to be full. You know, this thing is not quiet. It appears to be full, and on

top of that, the two casinos that existed for a very long time right next door to this

thing are closed down, so there's no, like, entertainment nearby. So the only entertainment

in this neighborhood would be this pool. So getting it, you know, like, advertising for

this pool, I don't know what their regulations are on, like, having public parties here,

but it sure would be a fun spot to have a DJ going, have a bar, and just sit and sit

by the pool, drink, and meet people. Now, the way the regulations are set with this

thing now is, you know, you can only have two guests. It is child-friendly, so you wouldn't

be able to serve alcohol unless you had designated hours to serve drinks and then close it and

make it 21 or over, but having two big pools just sitting here vacant, you know, there's

got to be a better way to utilize them, and me just sitting here, I'm just going to sit

here and advertise them on TikTok, Instagram, and Oaf and see if anything comes through

from it. Like I said before, I was thinking about moving around the city, but I am so

comfortable in this neighborhood, and it was successful the first time. Remember, it did

actually succeed. I was making $100,000 plus a year and had a good standing in the community.

So that was 10, 12 years ago, so it's a little dated maybe, but the thing, you know, I already

know the thing works. It was getting through my parents' baggage that uprooted me out of

here because my dad had a property in Winnemucca that I had to sell, and they had to drag me

to Boise to sell this house in Winnemucca, and then there was another property in Fish

Lake Valley, and I had to get dragged to California to sell the house in Fish Lake Valley that

my mom kept everything from. So that was everything that kind of ripped me out of Vegas in the

first place, and I was just trying to clean everything up so there wasn't any crime on

my name because I'd never been arrested, and I had no intention of like covering for crimes

my parents committed. So that's what caused me to get uprooted out of Vegas in the first

place. And, you know, sort of partying too much, although, you know, I wasn't chasing

after the pretty girls and wasn't paying them, you know, no one was paying anyone any money,

so there wasn't any crime committed. And they, you know, I was just trying to put the

brakes on the whole thing to get some sort of common ground to be able to talk to other

people about everything I was going through. So there wasn't really any issue with my first

pass on this thing, other than, you know, it was digging myself out enough to be able

to get married turned out to be a lot bigger climb than you would have expected. So I'm

trying to like see what's still around here in Vegas, what I can use and what I can make

money with. The biggest concern is what I can make money with now, whether it's film

production, adult entertainment, or, you know, working on the strip somewhere, card dealer.

You know, my dad always thought I was a card dealer in Vegas. I never actually dealt cards.

But, you know, I still have a basic understanding of how to deal cards. So that's always, that

would be Winnemucca's ideal is just make me a card dealer in Vegas and be done with it.

But I don't know, you know, I'm mostly educated and have a long back story to tell, so that's

got to be worth something. Anyway, thank you.

So I keep having to start from scratch. I can't sleep again. It was work in the first couple

nights I was able to sleep at night. Now I'm back to being awake. And I'm nowhere near

the Strip. And it's like twice as much for a bus ticket to go down there as it was in

Austin. You know, going downtown Austin is like $2. Here it's like $8. And that's only

a two-hour bus pass, so you can't...you can't do it round-trip. So I don't have enough to

go down there. I would be going down there getting footage. What I always used to do

in this town is when I couldn't sleep, I'd just go walk around the Strip and kind of

see tourists and go to the same spots over and over again. But now I'm so low on money

that it's impossible to do anything. There's all these little dive casinos nearby, but

they don't match the Strip. Now, like I said before, people were showing me rooms that

were closer downtown. I don't know if I'm going to go for them or not. Budget Suites.

I've stayed at Budget Suites before. It's always been my favorite. So they are closer,

but I think I'd still need a bus pass to get downtown anyway. So, you know, it's like the

same thing. Might as well be here with a twice the size hotel room and in this familiar

neighborhood that I've lived in before. So I'm going to keep walking along tonight, trying

to just cool down. You know, I've been uploading so many videos that...I don't know, I just

feel like talking a lot. So that's why I keep uploading videos. I was trying all the

Jacuzzi ones and now I'm back to the same pit I'm always in where I have to walk around

everywhere to be able to relax and get some rest when everyone else does. So I'm at what

appears to be a little bit of an outlet mall or strip mall or whatever. And maybe there's

something going on here. I'll look for any footage that's interesting. And, you know,

I started thinking, you know, type of woman I find attractive. I guess, you know, 30 plus

would be the start. You know, 30 years is older, older and not fat. Maybe not that real skinny

either. Kind of in the middle. As far as hair color, I don't know, brunette. You know, maybe

hair color doesn't matter as much, but it's like you treat people different with the color of

their hair. You know, I don't know what that is. It seems like the most superficial thing

in the world. And I don't know, kind of mixed, mixed or white, I guess.

So I've been trying to get an attorney. Uh, I had this problem in Austin too.

I called Austin and uh, called all the public, uh, uh,

attorneys. I can't remember what they're called,

but they're like the public service attorneys and I couldn't get a response.

And then I tried now I'm in Vegas and doing the same thing.

I can't get a response. So I don't know what the best path is.

I'm just going to sit here and keep talking into the phone until something

works. Uh, this jacuzzi is pretty nice. I gotta give it credit.

It's a little warm today.

It's kind of in this weird balance right now because the past couple of days

have been the first warm days of the year.

So the pool is still kind of cold, but the jacuzzi is warm.

So now it's too warm for the jacuzzi and uh,

the pool is still too cold despite it being warm outside.

So in a few more days, the pool will probably warm up. Uh, I'm gonna, you know,

like keep, uh, researching how, what my best legal options are.

Uh, I was watching the, uh, the real housewives of,

of Beverly Hills. And, uh,

she said on there that if a marriage lasts more than 10 years in California,

uh, the, uh, estate is divided 50 50.

So in the event of a divorce, it's 50 50 no matter what. Uh,

my parents were married for 20 years. Um, and my mom got everything like,

you know, that's what made me homeless.

She got everything for my dad and then everything for me. Uh, so,

um, uh, I don't know if that law carries over.

It sure would be nice if it did. Um,

cause that would really do me a favor. The only issue is, you know,

how you're influenced with some, you know,

some money influences you different from other, uh,

depending on where it's from. So like if you're paid, uh,

from, I don't know, a retail store,

then you're kind of the money is bracketed into that retail scene.

You know, you're, that's where the money is from. Now,

this money, both my mom's side and my dad's side is kind of a strange.

Uh, my grandparents had a tool company, as I've said before, that, uh,

went out of business and was purchased by a company in Beverly Hills. Um,

but that tool company went out of business and it was kind of in this weird,

like way too close to Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, kind of Confederate,

uh, area in Pennsylvania.

So I don't know if that money's racist or if money can be racist, but, uh,

you know, it's got a lot of Pennsylvania influence on it.

And then my dad's money is from, uh,

flying airplanes all over the place. So it's all transportation, um,

which causes, you know,

it influences me to start driving around all over the place, which I don't want.

So the second it gets researched of where that money is from, you know,

it's two awful, uh, areas, um,

extreme rural,

remote Alaska and Nevada without taxes being paid on it.

On my dad's side. And then my mom's side is this Confederate, uh,

tool company that used to operate out of Pennsylvania.

So both of those are pretty, uh,

pretty rough as far as the second people ask where the money is from.

You, you have to give those sources. Um,

and that still carries over despite being transferred, you know, twice now,

I guess. Um, it didn't really change where the money is from.

So that's a hurdle I have to go over. I like being right here at budget suites.

I don't want to move around. Um,

that's why I'm staying in place so much. You know, the second I land, you know,

I'm just kind of in place where that is. I don't move around a lot. Um,

so having, having too much of that money coming in,

then I start getting dragged around all over the place when it tries to find its

niche for itself, uh, in whatever community it's supposed to be in,

which doesn't even really exist anymore because it's been sitting stagnant for

so long. So that's what I'm going through today.

So I'm walking along like always. Every night this seems to happen. I'll be comfortable

and then I'll start getting restless and have to walk around. So I'm out on Rancho and Lake Mead

and too far from the Strip. You know, before when I lived here I'd just drive down to the Strip and

walk around down there. But now I'm going through this tourist thing where, you know, I have to be

really careful not to get like sucked in with a tourist because then I'll just get ripped out of

here again. I think that's what happened the first time is, you know, I got too swept up in

quote-unquote tourists and that like ripped me out of the city. So now I'm being careful about

who I talk to, who I interact with, and where, you know, what places I can go just so that

doesn't happen again. It wasn't even that much of a downward spiral the first time. You know,

it's not that much. I just went through the thing again. It's just not. So it's just me making dumb

choices, I guess, that caused me to get ripped out of here. But because I'm trying to stay

close to family, and my only family is my mom who is completely, you know, the saga continues

on that one. But I'm avoiding her, you know, as long as I have a place to sleep, you know, that's all.

I should be thankful for that. But I was looking at places that might pay because I'm just looking

for money. You know, it's just I need to earn money. I don't have any. So looking for places

that pay and the sphere, you know, that giant glowing ball when I was not in Las Vegas and just

watching clips online, that giant ball really stood out. I don't even know how they built it,

or how it was constructed, how it's even possible. But it has got to be the most impressive new thing

in this city. Like Resorts World, that looks pretty good too. But that sphere,

you know, and they're trying to get music and content on the screen so that there's

there's stuff to draw people in. So I was eyeing it. I don't know how to get my foot in the door

with the thing. I was going to record a clip of me just standing next to it and show the ball

from the side, but I haven't been able to make it down there. You know, I'm still, I'm putting

everything, all the money I make into housing. So just I have a place to stay.

And that doesn't leave much for transportation. So as soon as I can get some kind of way down there,

I may try the bus. But like I said before, the bus is considerably more expensive here.

And I don't know if I got to watch the traffic. Part of talking on the camera

is you got to be really careful because you'll walk right into traffic talking on this thing. So

I am trying not to get hit. I was watching the news earlier and they were talking about

the electric scooters here. See, in Austin, the electric scooters were everywhere. Like

every possible corner had electric scooters and bicycles and everything to do with them.

Here in Vegas, it looks like they're having a tough time getting them safe enough for

interacting with cars. I don't know how far behind the city is from Austin. I think Austin

is a little bit ahead on electric vehicles, electric scooters, all the pedestrian-esque

vehicles. So Vegas is a little behind but it should catch up. They're a really good idea

and they're cheap and efficient and they don't pollute and they're fun to get around on. You

cheer up when you're riding one. I was racing one around all over Austin,

the little uber scooters, the little uber green scooters. I was renting them and just

racing around all over Austin with them. So it's a lot of fun to ride one of those around.

But because Vegas is Vegas, you know, you got DUIs everywhere. There's all sorts of

reckless endangerment with the cars that it's more difficult to get it to work here.

So I don't know, you know, I'm not on the city council or anything, but I would invest more

money in having road safety so you could have these electric vehicles cruising around. Anyway,

thank you.

So it's the first 90 degree day at the pool today, but, uh,

it, uh, the pool water is still too cold. You know,

they said on the news that it's usually mid May when temperatures are this warm.

So, uh, the pool is still pretty cold. I'm not getting in. Um,

maybe, you know, I got my foot in there and it's, uh,

it's getting adjusted, but still, uh, it's, it's uncomfortable.

So there's a few people at the jacuzzi. I'm not going to encroach on their space,

but, um, I've just been, uh,

trying to figure out what the best attorney to go with is today.

Um, it looks like everyone, uh,

all the advertisements I see are for injury attorneys,

not a family law attorney.

So I need a family law attorney, um, which I haven't been able to locate.

Um, I'll keep looking around. You know, there were a few advertisements.

I didn't get the number for them,

but there were a few advertisements on there that allowed or that were, uh,

family attorneys. So, uh,

part of my past is digging up in Las Vegas. Uh, I didn't really,

I don't think I ever really upset anyone. So, uh, it,

it all looks pretty clean.

It looks like I'm in the clear as far as people being upset about it.

And this is my old neighborhood. Well,

it's a little South of my old neighborhood,

but it's all like really familiar, which is nice. Um,

so, uh, I'm trying to see what the best,

best path to take in Las Vegas is from here. Uh,

I'm just going to keep uploading videos on Tik TOK, Instagram, and Oath,

and, um, see what I can make out of it.

Oath is paying for my food right now. So any,

any, uh,

sales that are made on there are greatly appreciated cause that's what I'm using

to buy food at Walmart with. Um, so thank you very much.

And I'll try to post as much content as possible on Tik TOK,

Instagram, and Oath to, uh, keep this going.

So after tiptoeing in a little bit, I was able to brave the water.

It is pretty cold. Um, but it's the first 90 degree day. So, you know,

might as well dunk. I dunked myself twice in this thing. And you know,

I did get a shiver, uh, when I went under the first time, um,

my whole body shivered cause it was cold enough to do that.

But it seems like, you know, the outdoor temperature is so warm.

You'd think it would be warm enough, um, to just be able to jump in here,

but no, the water's still, I don't know. Pretty cold. Um,

if you stand in here long enough, you, you get adjusted to it though. Um,

so then it gets comfortable. Now I'm just saying like the, uh,

water evaporative dry off my skin and make me even colder so that I can just

dunk in the water much easier.

But it's great having a pool that's nice at this hotel. Uh,

like I said before, I think budget suites is my favorite, um, hotel. Uh,

there were a few other people here, but you know, I didn't want to, uh,

try to encroach and start a conversation with them. This thing could use more,

uh, more of a party. You know,

I don't want to say party cause I'll get in trouble. Um,

because this is a residential pool, not a, uh, casino pool.

Most of my past here in Vegas, um, we would, you know,

I'd have my house pool and it was probably eight feet deep or so.

Um, and we'd have good size house parties there.

And then we'd go down to the strip and go to the locals pool parties at the

casinos. So that's what went on for most of my twenties.

And I'm going through the whole thing now,

trying to see what's recoverable and, uh, what's profitable.

Um, but, uh, you know, because I don't have any transportation, I'm,

I'm at this hotel, uh, until, uh, some kind of door opens up.

I, when I spoke to the police and told them my story at the airport,

uh, they said, I need an attorney, just hire an attorney. So, uh, I'm,

that's what I'm doing now. I'm just calling for attorneys and, uh,

seeing what's available. Um, I've never needed an attorney for anything.

I don't think I've ever used one. I've only had one,

only taken one thing to court. And that was, I had a couple of Siberian Huskies.

They got out of the backyard in Idaho and they had out of state dog tags on

them.

So Idaho wrote me a citation for having dogs without a state dog tags,

but I'd only been in the state for two weeks or something. Um,

so I took the thing to trial and won the case on my own, uh,

without an attorney whatsoever. Um, and remove,

I had the citation removed just because I didn't have enough time.

I had just gotten to the state to, to change over the dog tags. Um,

but that was my one court experience in my life. Uh, so I,

you know, they're gonna,

whoever I call is going to have to know how to do this cause I don't.

So I came back down to the pool. Uh, I'm in the jacuzzi now, the pool's too cold.

Uh, so I, uh,

this thing reminds me of the hot springs in central and rural Nevada,

northern Nevada too. Um, both Dyer, uh, Dyer Fish Lake Valley.

Um, they had hot springs out there that I used to go sit in when it was snowing.

They were that warm that it could be like 10,

20 degrees outside and you could still sit in the hot springs. Um,

and also just outside of Winnemucca,

there were hot springs that would go to periodically. So, uh,

they've always been fun. I like the jacuzzi more. Um,

truth be told just because it is nerve wracking being out in the middle of

nowhere, all by yourself, sitting in hot springs. Um, it, uh, you know,

you never know what's going to drive up on you and, and, uh, uh, not,

you know, most of those places,

at least at the time when I was there didn't have cell phone service.

So I, uh, uh, you were out there without a cell phone all by yourself.

So this is better. I, uh, I'm probably gonna,

I've only been sitting in this thing for 10 minutes at a time.

I'm trying to extend that a little bit. Uh, anyway, thank you.

So during my first tour of Las Vegas, I actually saw the casino this sign is from

get imploded. I had a bunch of memorabilia from the Stardust and, you know, cups.

Maybe it was just two cups, but it was still memorabilia. I think I ended up donating those

to Goodwill, but everyone seems to covet the Stardust. I was pretty impressed when I first

walked here into Resorts World that they had the Stardust neon sign right in front.

I'm wondering if they're ever going to rebuild it. It was a big deal when it existed and the

only implosions I saw when I was here the first time were the Stardust and the Frontier. I was

able to see the Frontier implosion too. It was right next to Treasure Island and they were fun

to watch. You know, they have fireworks go off and you see the whole building fall.

So now starting my second tour of Las Vegas, we'll see how this one goes. The last time,

you know, I ended up partying too much and sleeping around and collapsing out of town

would be the way to put it. This time, like I brainwashed myself, you know, I just want to

get married. So maybe if I steer the entire course this time to getting married, it'll have a happier

ending. So I made it to the entryway of one of the nightclubs here. They want 50 bucks to get

in there and I took the bus to get down here so I don't have money to go in there. But I got the

entryway. You know, I never actually worked nightclubs but I did work security for the Mirage

when I lived here before and the nightclub security was always the worst because there

were always fights going in there. I think it was called Jet Nightclub at the Mirage then

and there were always fights going on in there and it was the roughest place to work in the

whole casino. So I don't know if this one's any better. There doesn't appear to be anyone here

despite wanting 50 bucks to get in. So I won't be able to make it at least tonight unless I can

get an invite somehow. I'll be stuck outside. So I made it to the blackjack room in Resorts World

and both my parents were blackjack dealers. I never played blackjack that much when I was here

the first time. I kind of, I was really cheap. You know, I'd play the nickel slots just to get

free drinks and that's about as far into gambling as I went. Probably played blackjack like four

times in the 10 years I was here. So it's nice to have it. I'm looking for the poker room. They

just told me where the poker room is now. I do like Texas Hold'em although I play it at house

parties and don't play it at casinos. Once again, no money so it's kind of out. So I made it to the

poker room at Resorts World and there's a few people playing here. I always liked poker better

than anything else. You know, as far as gaming goes, poker was my favorite. I never really played

in the casinos, never played in tournaments. I did a free tournament in Phoenix, Arizona. That's as

far as I got with poker. But we would play at house parties, sometimes at work. I mostly know

how to deal Texas Hold'em although, you know, remembering which hand is better, a straight or a

flush, some of those I forget. So I'm still learning but I did get Texas Hold'em mostly down

as far as dealing and that's the only one I can deal. You know, blackjack's sort of, you know,

I sort of remember how to deal blackjack but Texas Hold'em, five card poker, those I put my

effort into. This is an extremely nice poker room. It's my first time in Resorts World and they have

a really nice poker room here. I don't know if they have tournaments or what they do with it

but they got a few people here on Friday night. So I'm at one of the merchandise stores and they

have an autographed Luke Bryan guitar here. And me buying that acoustic guitar in Austin

put me in like the whole acoustic guitar like mindset. And this Luke Bryan, I sure know him by

name because one of his albums I owned probably eight years ago. But that Country Girl Shake for

Me song, I ended up buying the album because that one song was so good. So it's pretty cool

seeing his guitar here. I don't know if he had a residency or not. I see Cary Underwood is the

residency right now but they have his little guitar tucked back here. So I decided to get a

clip of it. The slot machine screens have grown considerably since the last time I was here.

You know they were tiny little screens with some of them were still nickel slots. Now they have

these gigantic 40 inch screens on everything or bigger you know maybe that's even bigger.

So having that much screen in front of you is considerably different from how it was before.

I'm trying not to step on any toes but I still play Doom quite a bit. I'm playing Doom 2016

in that arcade mode. The thing runs exactly like a slot machine only you know you're playing a

first person shooter. But all the arcade like things going off are the same kind of thing.

So I don't know if that's stepping on the slot machine toes. I don't gamble at all.

So I just play first person shooters. I like going to the casinos to walk around and talk to people

but I don't really gamble. So I stick to first person shooters and whatever video games I'm into

for my screen time. So they got a much smaller but still very gigantic ball in Resorts World here.

I know I haven't made it to the Sphere yet so I'm still at Resorts World but they do have a good

size ball. You know when I saw clips of this thing when it first opened they had all sorts of like

art things going on the screen but now it's just mostly advertisement. I also noticed there are

three levels to this thing but the upper two levels are closed. So I don't know if that's

because it's after hours. You know I'm here late. It's late on a Friday night so I don't know if

those are open during the day. I'll try to come back down here. It wasn't that difficult to take

the bus down here. I did have to do one transfer from the regular city bus to the Vegas Strip

Deuce and then was able to get down to Resorts World on the Deuce. But it skips parking and gas

and insurance and everything just riding the bus down here. So that made it really easy.

It looks like that nightclub you know there I was here 20-30 minutes ago there was no one at the

nightclub. Now everyone is waiting in line there so I don't know if it just opened or what but now

there's a whole whole pack of people standing out in front of it. So standing outside the building

I actually got comped into that nightclub but I have no place to put my backpack. They want

20 bucks for the concierge at the nightclub and then they also said well you can go the hotel

concierge and they were both closed. There's two hotel concierge both the Hilton and the Conrad in

this hotel. They were both closed so there's no place to put my backpack for this nightclub

that they invited me into but then won $20 for the backpack so I gave up. Here's the outside of

the building. This is the best little angle I could get you know it's a gigantic building so

standing out here I don't know I may walk around a little bit and see what else is new in town.

I'm trying not to walk too much you know what happened the first time why I couldn't sleep and

couldn't stop walking everywhere in the country was because my pastime here in Vegas was at night

to just walk around the strip to like you know burn off angst so that's what I used to do before

and I think that habit kind of carried over to everywhere so I don't want to encourage it too

much because they'll just get way out of control again but I'm gonna walk around a little bit and

see what else is going on downtown.

So I made my way back down to Fremont Street. There's a giant dancing gorilla here.

Quite a bit going on. There's the canopy.

And I'm trying not to record people's faces, but it's pretty difficult. Here's that gorilla again.

All he does is that. So I'm gonna walk around here and see what clips I can get.

Made it down to Fremont East to this little bar called The Griffin, I think.

I remember when this place opened. You know, Fremont East is very similar to 6th Street in

Austin. So this is familiar from where I just came from, but also familiar from living here

10 years ago. So they have a little band set up here, but there's no band playing. So I don't

know if they're gonna start it up later. I remember one of these had a patio and they would

have live music out of the patio, but this bar is closed. I was gonna make a clip of the main room,

but it is so full of people. I'm just doing the back room clip. Found a spot to sit in the main

room. I'll do a quick pan of the thing. You can see it's pretty full. Hope they don't mind my lights.

I guess they do. So we'll see what's going on here. I don't know how long I'm gonna stay,

but I'm trying to bounce around and see what opportunities present themselves.

Here's the main drag of Fremont East. There's a lot of people here tonight. It's Friday night,

right at, I guess, rush hour for Fremont. All the bars look new. There's only a few

of the old ones still here. There used to be an arcade right next door to me. I guess they

closed that down. The Griffin opened right when I left the first time, so it's still here,

but the rest is chased around. Here's another clip of the Fremont Street experience. We've

got zip lines going on, band playing, and a whole crowd of people out tonight. So I gotta get back.

The last bus is at like 2 a.m. It's 12 30 now, so I'm gonna have to start walking back.

It's pretty cheap taking the bus down here. Made my way down to the plaza. This place was

made famous in the Back to the Future movies. It was Gibbs Pleasure Palace. They just put the...

Hi! There you go. So everyone's having a good time tonight. I still remember this thing from

Back to the Future 2. I don't know, it did a number on me when I was a kid.

I'm gonna keep walking around and see what footage should appear. This plaza has a nice

little gym in the casino. I didn't even know this was here, but they have a gym sitting back here.

I am gym deprived after leaving Austin. I was going to Gold's Gym there,

and I still haven't made my way to LVAC, which is probably where I'll end up.

I went to LVAC for 6-7 years when I lived in Vegas the first time. My main gym is right down

the street from where I am now, so I'm not far away from the gym I went to quite a bit in my

20s. Still going through the memories of this thing and seeing what stories to tell. They have

a teeny tiny little wedding chapel in this plaza. I think that's the whole thing. You can see the

entire wedding chapel. I've never been married before, and I could just shotgun marry a stripper

here in Vegas, but I don't have any money. That's still the limiting factor. So I'm just going

around looking for clips. I had never even looked at wedding chapels when I was here before.

I don't think I'd ever been in one. One of my friends got married and I went to the wedding

for that, and that was the only marriage anything I ever got involved with. I don't know.

Maybe hindsight is 20-20, but I should have, when I was 30, just piled into every wedding chapel

in the city just to get married when I turned 30. I'm 42 now, and now I have to push through

to get all the wedding available. Back when I lived here in my 20s, I spent a lot of time at

this pool. It's Friday night tonight, so it doesn't look like they have anything going on,

but it's the Golden Nugget Pool, and this was one of my favorites. They have an aquarium in

the middle with a water slide. You can see a white shark going by right there,

or whatever. Great white shark? Is that what that thing's called? Anyway, I came here quite a bit.

They have a water slide in the center of the thing that you can slide down through all the fish

into the pool, and they used to have locals parties here. This was one of the local party

spots I would go to because it was free to get in, and you could sit here all day, so it's quite

a bit of fun. Bring a few people with you. Now, I'm trying to change my social circle around

learning what failed the first time and how to fix it so it doesn't fail again.

I'm being really careful about who I talk to and who I'm going to allow be in my friends

while I'm here. So I'm now walking off Fremont trying to figure out where all the girls are,

and they're with these two right here. They must have the girls' attention of everyone

in like a 50-foot radius, so that's how to do it. Just get in excessively good shape,

and you'll have nothing but success. So the last bus of the night leaves pretty soon. I got like

25 minutes or something, so I came down to the bus stop. It's not that far from Fremont.

Fremont's right down there. This is just a little pan around. When I was here before, I saw Formula

One. I stood right in this spot, and the cars, the Formula One cars were jumping that hill.

They were actually catching air and setting sparks off everywhere. So that's the only

memory I have of this spot, but there's like no one out here. Fremont is still packed. Everyone's

still down on Fremont. If the buses ran later, I might stay longer, but there's like a two-hour

no-bus area between like 2 30 a.m. and 4 30 a.m., so I'm avoiding that and just going back now.

This is going to be a lot to edit and put back together. This is probably the most edits I've

ever put in a video, so thank you.

So I've been going through film production and Apple computers and how Apple has always been

synonymous with making films. You know, making whatever video footage you're into. Whether

that's movies, music, potentially adult entertainment. I don't know if they allow

adult entertainment on Apple computers. I haven't used an Apple in a long time,

but they have this Max Studio and I'm using a $300 HP laptop for video editing and a $80

Motorola cell phone as my camera. So I don't know if using Apple products would put me

in the film production mindset of producing better content to be worth the initial investment.

The problem I've had with Apple is the initial investment of the thing is a lot. $2,000 for their

Max Studio is a lot of money in comparison to a $300 HP laptop, but I don't know if it's necessary

to be like, I'm going through being in the right social circles, like the social circle I'm

supposed to be in to be like part of the team or whatever. And using all my hodgepodge to everything

to make it work kind of makes me an outsider, which I'm trying not to be. I don't want to be

the the outsider in the whole thing. So I'm eyeing these old Apples. I have worked on Apple

computers before. I'm in Las Vegas. I worked for like doctor's offices and the golf courses,

although I don't think the golf courses had any Apples. Those doctor's offices sure did. And you

know, all I was really doing was setting up dual boot on them so you could run Windows on an Apple

so they could use their medical software on the Apple computer. So I don't have much experience

with macOS, but I've heard, you know, it doesn't need as much services as Windows. So

because I'm switching from a technician to like just film production content creator,

adult entertainer, I'm wondering if Apple is a better solution than the Motorola

HP combination I'm using now. So I'm going to keep looking at it. I'm thinking about like just going

down and hanging around the Apple store at Fashion Show Mall, which is on the Strip in Vegas.

There's also one in Summerlin. They're building a movie studio in Summerlin that I was eyeing too,

although I think the farthest I get right now is just in advertising. I don't have any

acting experience. And music, you know, I can sit and listen to music and like determine whether I

like a song or not, but I still haven't been able to learn that acoustic guitar. So maybe someday

I'll be able to learn the acoustic guitar. And you know, I'm doing adult entertainment, which is the

only thing that's paying on OnlyFans. The only money I have coming in, short of TikTok, you know,

I'm getting like 300 bucks a month from TikTok, but OnlyFans is also paying probably another 300

bucks a month. So that does earn money. And you know, it kind of continues my social welfare. You

know, what I was doing on the streets, just like talking people through whatever they were going

through and trying to find the best path for me to take and for others to take to be successful.

And continuing that with adult entertainment, you know, it's kind of the same thing. You know,

you're just talking to each other through whatever your problems, whatever problems you're having,

being supportive and producing a product. You know, the problem I'm having is 20 years ago

with computers, they needed so much repair and technician service that that's where the money was.

And now it looks like where the money is, is just putting content on the screen for people to watch

because the whole system works on its own. You don't need to repair it that much. So that's

why I got into this content creation thing. And on top of that, adult entertainment, you know,

if you want to push the envelope a little bit, just go full stripper on there and you'll actually

get money in because you're just pushing it a little farther than everyone else is. And it's,

it's not even that much. It doesn't change your life that much, at least for me, but I was well

endowed to start. I've done adult entertainment before. It was nothing like new for me. So,

uh, uh, you know, it, uh, it does bring money in just using this little plastic box. You know,

how do you get money out of this little plastic box? Well, this is what I figured out how to do

is just record myself, record everything of myself on here and just upload it and

get money that way. So that's what I'm doing anyway. Thank you.

So I made my way to the Cosmopolitan, I'm gonna try and get some footage here.

The reason I came down is I was watching TikTok videos and saw that Cindy

Sweeney broke up with whatever her fiancé was and ended up being seen with

Glenn Powell. And I just got back from Austin, Texas. He's from Austin and

everything is swept up in him going to the University of Texas at Austin. And

he's a big deal out there. But the on-again, off-again Cindy Sweeney and

that his mom doesn't approve of is pretty funny. I see some similarities

between me and him, although he seems to sit much higher in the water than I do.

I had an ex-girlfriend very similar to Cindy Sweeney, although she was tatted up

goth and ended up cheating on me, so I broke up with her.

But getting into that Glenn Powell thing, I was thinking, you know, his arch-rival

what his arch-rival's name would be. The best I could come up with was Max Power.

You know, the guy, it was a character from The Simpsons where Homer changed

his name to Max Power because it was a really strong sounding name. I thought

that was the funniest name for an arch-rival to Glenn Powell possible is

the name Max Power. So I'm gonna walk around here and film a little bit until

someone complains about it, and then probably see what else is going on downtown.

So I was walking through the Cosmopolitan and I saw they had a row of old guitars here.

I don't know much on the story of them, it's just a really cool display of guitars.

I still have that acoustic guitar sitting there that, you know, I haven't

learned how to play. And I was trying in Austin to learn, you know, to get someone

to teach me how to play that guitar, but they wanted $200 an hour for an

undergrad at the University, which I just didn't have enough money coming in to

pay that much in Austin. Now hopefully if I keep hustling Vegas, you know, I might

be able to start earning a decent living again because I made pretty good income

here before until the downward spiral that I had to retreat from the city from.

So trying to earn that money again without going through the downward

spiral of alcohol and girls from online dating and all of that. But that's a

story for another day. But anyway, going back to these guitars, I just have an

acoustic guitar. It has an electric hookup, but I haven't even tried to see if that

works. I just use it as basic plucking on the acoustic guitar that maybe you

could use for sampling. I don't know.

So I'm still in the Cosmopolitan. I was talking to these guys. They have a free

pool table here. So they're over here playing free pool. I can't believe they

have this going on here. It has been so long since I've seen a free pool table,

especially since I just walked into the Cosmopolitan to tell stories about

concerts and celebrities that have recently been here. So I don't know. They

wanted to play two-on-two, and it's just me, so I don't have another person to

play doubles at pool. But it's one of my favorite games to play. When I was in

Vegas the first time, we used to go out and play pool all the time. Made it out

to the pool area, although the pool is closed. So if it were up to me, I would

keep the jacuzzi open at night and have a place to get drinks so you can sit out

at the jacuzzi at night and see everything. But you know, I'm not the

decision maker at the Cosmopolitan, so it's really up to them. I did get this

close at least. It took multiple elevators and a failed escalator attempt

to get here. So I hope to see this pool at some point. I think I've been here

before. To one of the Cosmopolitan pools, it was to watch an infected mushroom

concert, which is this Israeli techno band. So I was down here close to when

Cosmopolitan opened to see Infected Mushroom, which was a pretty good concert.

You know, you got to watch it by the pool, and there were drinks being served and

everything. I don't know if they're still hosting concerts here or not. There's

only a few artists I'd come down to see, Infected Mushroom being one of them,

because they've just been really good for a long time. I just got in this glass

elevator. It's pretty nifty. As you can see, I'm going down. I'm sure everyone can

see the spotlight off my phone. I was wondering how many lights I can attach

to one cell phone just to be as blinding and obnoxious as possible. But as for

right now, I just have two lights on it. I was eyeing, there's a speakeasy

attached to where those guitars are. I was wondering how many spotlights I could

put on my phone just to be abnormally blinding to everyone when you turn on

all the lights to record yourself. So anyway, that was the glass elevator. I'm

down at the bottom floor now of the Cosmopolitan Hotel, and that thing's

pretty cool. I don't know, there's not much else to film in this casino, so I'm

probably going to wander around outside and see if anything's going on. Anyway,

thank you.

So I've just been sitting in the hotel room the past couple of days.

Um, I, uh,

the only thing that's making money right now is OnlyFans and TikTok.

And I don't know, you know, TikTok really has me concerned.

That's why I have the OnlyFans going as well. Um, because, uh,

it, uh, it is cash, you know,

it gets me in the whole, uh, Vegas stripper circle,

but that's not that big of a deal. You know, I can go down to Fremont street,

um, talk to the guys down there and, uh, potentially make some money.

just completely switching social circles from what I was in in Vegas before.

Uh, when I was in Vegas before I was doing IT constantly. Um,

it was all networking and server repair and stuff like that.

So, um, switching to the stripper thing, I don't know, uh,

how, how far it's going to go, but because I'm well endowed, you know, um,

that seems like, you know, an option at least.

So, uh, I did, I did bring up my old pastime of drinking whiskey here.

Um, this hotel room is very similar to the house I had right up the street.

Like everything's the exact same system it was then. So, uh,

uh, whiskey, you know, whiskey was fun then when I lived here and it's fun now.

Uh, when I was in Austin, I couldn't drink whiskey at all. I don't know.

I tried and it just wouldn't work. Whereas in Vegas it,

it just goes like, like you wouldn't believe. So, um, I'm,

uh, I'm trying to monitor it to not be too much, but, uh,

it was a fun pastime living here the first time. Uh,

so because I'm lacking transportation, uh,

going down to the strip and, uh, all the casinos is difficult. Uh,

I have to take two buses to get down there, um,

which takes like an hour and a half.

So I've just been sitting in the hotel room trying to come up with content,

trying to come up with new ideas, uh,

stuff to film in the city that, that will make money. Um,

whether it's me or, uh, uh, clips of tourists,

you know, street performers, musicians, um,

various casinos, whatever, uh, just to keep money coming in.

So I'm going to keep uploading on here and, uh,

try to make the most of it. Thank you.

So I made my way back to the pool again. It's the first warm day in the past week or so.

It's been kind of overcast and windy, so I made it back to the pool. The pool water is still too

cold to get in. I don't think the season starts until like May, but this is bringing back memories

of when I lived in Vegas the first time. My pool was, you know, it was right down the street from

here. And, you know, the whole system, like I was saying, the whole system of this hotel

is similar to that house. You know, it was a pool with a house. This is a hotel room with a pool.

And it's in the same neighborhood, roughly, you know, a few miles away.

So all of that's really similar. So I can kind of get my old pool system going here.

But speaking of pools, you know, they used to have local pool parties in Vegas. And I went

to the Golden Nugget and they said they weren't doing the local pool parties anymore. So I don't

know which ones have shut down and which ones are still going. But at least Golden Nugget was out,

which was one of my favorites. They have a fish tank in the center of it. I put some footage of

it on here. But, you know, we would go to the Palms. I can't remember where else. Mandalay Bay,

they would have movie nights at Mandalay Bay. So that's where I would go swim on the strip.

But at the tail end of the thing, the Mirage became my base just because I worked for the Mirage.

And, you know, we had two pools at the Mirage. One was like a family pool and the other one was

an adult pool. In the adult pool, like some people would take their clothes off and it was fun. You

know, there was a bar right there you could drink. So the Mirage closed down and I don't know if

they're imploding it or not, but it closed down. So I went over to the Flamingo to see what pools

the Flamingo had. Back in the day, the Flamingo was the arch rival to the Mirage. The Flamingo

existed and then they built a Mirage right next door, which was 10 times bigger. And it turned

into this competition. But it looks like the Flamingo won in the end because they're tearing

down the Mirage. So it started out before and lasted longer. Anyway, I went over to the Flamingo.

They do have two pools there, the whole family pool and adult pool, but the adult pools closed

down until May. So, you know, got some time before it reopens. I don't know where to go in Vegas

to make a profit. You know, that's my next thing. You know, cash in my hand is all I'm looking for.

And as it sits now, the two things that are putting cash in my hand are, well, three things.

One coming from this old estate, two coming from TikTok and three coming from OnlyFans.

So those are the three cash in hand operations I have going. I don't know if there's any way

to get paid to sit in the pool, maybe doing these clips, inviting tourists to go on

day trips, you know, with some of my experience to learn from. I'm just looking for

any way to make money in this town. And pools were always really successful the first time.

It was just a successful thing. It was successful at my house, successful on the Strip. So the only

money I can really find that's like right now is just go standing in one of those circles

on Fremont Street with my shirt off and potentially with the guitar, potentially not.

I don't know if that guitar steps on any toes. I wouldn't even be able to play it. I'd just

stand there and like look as attractive as possible and see if any tips come in.

So that's the only money I can find. There are a bunch of pools on Fremont Street, too.

The Golden Nugget being one of them and being my favorite. But I think the Plaza has a good

size pool and a few of the other casinos there do, too. So having this many pools available

is awesome because Austin, you know, there wasn't a single pool that worked anywhere in that city

that I could find, that I could go to at least. See this one, I was sitting in the pool the day

I got here. So it was much, much easier. It doesn't hurt, you know, I'm originally from Nevada

and Las Vegas is very much Nevada. So it doesn't hurt that I'm from Nevada and in Nevada.

Kind of greases things along. Whereas in Texas, you know, I was from Nevada in Texas, which was a

little weird. Like why did I need to be there? What fight did I get myself into that got me ran

out of Nevada in the first place? And so that's what I'm going through now when it was just this

legal pile with my parents that ran me off in the first place. So I'm going back through it now

with this completely new system. You know, before I was doing I.T. and now this is all content

creation. You know, just whatever content I can put into this camera and on to TikTok, OnlyFans,

Instagram is what I'm doing until something pans out correctly. So I don't particularly want to go

near my old contacts that were here. I don't know. A bunch of them start getting arrested.

The whole thing kind of piled weird and I may just keep hustling around to make some new friends

and stay out of it. I know it turned into a big pile of drama too. So I don't want to. I don't

want to get swept up in it again. And the whole basis for the social circle I had the first time

was we all worked for Circuit City and Circuit City closed down a long time ago. So maintaining

that is pretty difficult at this point. You know, working together in a defunct store that went

under, I don't know, 15 years ago. So it's not worth the effort when, you know, I need to make

new co-workers that actually turn a profit. So I'm going to sit in this pool for the day

and try to come up with content. Anyway, thank you.

So, I decided to do a video of what I've been eating.

It's mostly just these ramen noodles,

but I put a lot of toppings on it.

I put cheese,

turkey,

vegetables, and butter

on top of it.

And,

it's really good.

I'll show halfway through the preparation. First, I put these little

turkey slices on top of it.

And, I'm using two

sheets of turkey.

Next are these mixed vegetables.

I'm being liberal with the butter. I don't know.

I put a lot on there because the ramen noodles taste really good with butter.

And lastly, two slices of cheese.

After two minutes in the microwave, here's the finished

result. I put so much butter on it that the butter didn't quite melt.

But,

this is a really good meal.

It costs maybe

maybe a dollar, maybe less than a dollar for this entire thing.

And, it's a lot of food. Every single one of these is a lot of food.

Now, a lot of times I put more vegetables on it.

I was out of that, or that's the last of my vegetables, so

that'll have to do.

But, I'll go to the store later

pick up more.

So, this is what I've been mostly living on

to stay fed. It's cheaper than anything.

I can't find a cheaper meal

than this

anywhere. You know, I get all the ingredients at Walmart

and throw it together and get a big hearty meal

for very little money.

You know, you can't get TV dinners

for less than a dollar,

which is what this thing costs.

I'm going to keep eating these. I've been eating these ramen noodle

packets

since I was a small child.

You know, as a little kid I would just

break them up in the packaging and eat it raw, and that was like my meal

half the time.

So, I am completely

dedicated to eating ramen noodles because I have since I was young.

It's so cheap and so available and just

easy to make. It's easy food.

I think the sodium is a little high in them,

but they're really good.

So, that's usually what I live off of.

Anyway, thank you.

So, trying to find footage in Vegas and because I'm bound to the bus system,

it's pretty difficult to go downtown. I have a call with an attorney tomorrow. I think one of

the public service attorneys tomorrow. So, we'll see how that goes. I'll tell them the whole story

and see if there's any kind of a case I can use to make some progress on this whole thing.

But, I'm just out walking right now. Because I'm in a different city and different everything,

trying not to cling on to Austin or think about Austin too much has become a priority.

The reason I moved to Vegas is because my only family member is my mom and I know she committed

that power of attorney scheme to drain all the check-in counts. But, now I'm stuck between

association and family members. So, I'm trying, working very hard to not

be guilty of association in any way. But also, she's my only living family member. So,

I'm going to tell all this to the attorney tomorrow and see if, like I said before,

see if there's anything that can be done. But, as for now, I was tempted to go down to Fremont,

but now I'm just walking around Lake Mead and Lake Mead Boulevard, not Lake Mead Lake,

and seeing if there's anything interesting around here. It's a really quiet area,

just a peaceful area. There were two casinos near the hotel I'm staying at,

but they both closed down. So, now it's just really quiet in this area. But, it's close to Walmart.

And, you know, I was looking at other places that are cheaper, but they're not walking distance to

Walmart, whereas this one is. So, it's a really good deal for that reason. Also, it being so

similar to the house I had when I lived here doesn't hurt. You know, it's the same people

nearby that it was before. So, that makes everything kind of easy. Anyway, thank you.

So, now I'm up to twice a day, Fungi Clear, this Old Spice Body Wash, and Jock Itch Powder,

Preparation H, Healing Overnight Gold Bond Lotion, and Emu-Aid Max, all to clear jock

itch that hasn't cleared. So, this has been going on for a year and a half, or longer,

of me treating this twice a day with no resolution. I don't know how many over-the-counter topical

creams I have to put on to get a simple little itch to go away, but this is what I'm going

through trying to clear this jock itch. It has been there for years. I've told this story

before on here. It has been there for years, and I've exhausted every possible avenue on

getting rid of it. It just won't go away. I have seen doctors about it, and they said

it doesn't classify as an STD, and over-the-counter treatment should be adequate. So, I don't

know what to do. I'm still fishing for ideas on how to get rid of it.

When I first noticed that jock itch, I went on online dating. I think I was in Phoenix,

Arizona, and I went on online dating and started dating this Native American woman. I noticed

an odor with her, but didn't think much of it, and then later, a few weeks later, had

this itch. That was over 20 years ago, and it's still just going. So, I tried everything

then. I talked to a bunch of doctors and physicians, and tried everything then to get

rid of it, and I've been constantly, as I just said, I have been putting all sorts of

treatments on it. So, that's what I'm going through. I'm open to ideas on how to properly

diagnose it, potentially, and treat it. Anyway, thank you.

So I was going to take the bus to go down to Fremont Street,

but it takes so long to get anywhere on that bus that now I'm just walking around

out here. And I checked the schedule on the thing.

It said it was going to be like a 23 minutes before it was coming to that stop.

So I walked away and then, you know, when I was like five minutes away,

the bus went right by. So I don't,

I don't know what's going on with Vegas's scheduling system on the bus. Um,

it takes another hour to get down there.

So I thought it was like an hour and a half. I'm like,

I'll just walk around here. It's, uh, it's not worth the effort.

I'm at the corner of a Lake Mead and Rancho and,

uh, not a lot going on. You know,

this isn't the most exciting part of Vegas. Um, but, uh, you know,

once again, I couldn't sleep last night. Uh, stayed up all night.

I'm trying to like Jerry rig my food system.

So I eat breakfast food in the morning and then lunch food for lunch and dinner

food for dinner.

So I kind of set into that schedule and then hopefully can sleep at night.

Cause I'm still like completely backwards on sleep schedule.

You know, up all night, usually sleep all day.

Although today I had a diet Dr. Pepper in the morning. Uh, so that's,

that's keeping me up and, uh, trying, you know,

walking around here.

I was expecting a call back from that attorney that never happened.

And this track phone, I'm using a track phone that was, uh,

I think it's like $15 a month,

which is the best possible price you can get for yourself. I mean,

nothing beats this thing. I only get like four gigs of data,

but it's unlimited talk and text. The, uh,

the only issue is the signal to the thing in the hotel room.

Isn't the greatest, like it just drops. Um,

so I was receiving phone calls on, I don't know if it missed completely.

I never saw a voicemail pop up,

but I gave a full speech to the student attorney that called and told him the

entire case and never got a call back.

So this is like the fifth time this has happened. I don't know.

When I talked to the police at the airport,

the only advice they could give was get an attorney. And, uh,

I tried and it just wouldn't, you know, it won't go through.

When you're the defendant, it's really easy to get an attorney.

When you're the prosecutor, it's extremely difficult.

So me being on the prosecutor side,

it's not the easiest thing to accomplish.

So I, uh, I'm just walking around here, working up,

working on content ideas and, and, uh,

trying not to sit in that hotel room too much. Um, that's,

uh, you know,

it gets really stale in there after a while just, uh, sitting around.

So I, uh, decided to go out walking and, uh,

upload videos into here and, and see what happens. Anyway. Thank you.

So my last video, or second to last video, did pretty well.

It's pretty strange to know what video is going to launch like that and which one isn't.

You can see it went through its peak and is now going back down now.

I don't know, I think I got 212,000 views on jock itch treatment.

So people really want to watch clips about treating jock itch.

I'm sure it's like everywhere and just no one's talking about it.

My solution, and you know I've gotten to the point now, I have some weird itch,

but I don't know if it's jock itch or what.

So I'm just doing the same treatment options, but I'm just kind of throwing money

at anything that can treat any sort of rash or infection.

So I'm just buying up every product that says jock itch, rash, irritation, anti-itch.

I'm just buying it all and hoping that will get it to clear.

At the end of the day, the more money you throw at it, the sooner there's a solution.

And none of this stuff costs very much. It's like $10 for a tube, so it's not that expensive.

But I'm really trying to get this rash clear and gone completely.

And that is my solution.

Because the video did so well, there's only so many speeches I can give about jock itch

and fungal infection and STDs in general.

Like I said before, I got STD tested in Austin.

And the full blood work, full panel STD testing came up completely clear.

They didn't test for cold sores, herpes, HSV.

So that one wasn't tested for. I have had a cold sore years ago.

So it probably is there, but it's not very common or often.

But other than that, tested completely clean with Austin's Planned Parenthood STD test.

They don't even include jock itch as an STD, which I've probably said a million times on here.

So that's my own battle.

And it's amazing the amount of mental loopholes you go through going through jock itch treatment.

Then you go through all the paranoia of what if it's not jock itch, what if it's something else,

what if I can never get rid of it, and all of that.

And the more brands you can throw at the thing, the more it goes away.

The more companies that are earning a living from reducing rashes,

the more of them you pay, the sooner you don't have a rash anymore.

So that's my solution to this problem.

I'm going to keep fighting it. I don't know if it's there or not right now, but it could be.

I have a few spots on my ankle. I don't know if I can show them.

I don't know if that's ringworm. It probably is.

So I'm still fighting this thing as much as I can.

That could be just nothing too. I can't even see it.

From my perspective, I have to use the camera to be able to see it.

But that's what I'm going through with a very common fungal infection.

And I'm just sitting in the hotel room because I don't have transportation.

The quote-unquote gears of success are trying to be able to sleep at night correctly

and be as productive as possible.

What I'm doing now is completely film production.

I'm just 100% film production.

Anything I can point this little plastic platter at and record is what I'm looking for.

The same principle as the jock itch treatment.

Only throw as many hours into putting content on the computer and cell phone, video content,

to get my foot in the door and earn a living just by recording everything.

So that's what I'm doing today.

Still going through what's happening to the other content creators.

I just saw that Hawk Tua girl.

See, I haven't been watching TikTok very much.

And that Hawk Tua girl, that is the worst scam I have ever seen.

I can't believe that.

They said she got away with $25 million and is going to jail.

That is obnoxious.

I'm avoiding all of those schemes and scams and get-rich-quick ploys.

On the content creator side, you'll see them pop up.

I've never been arrested.

I'm very careful about not breaking the law in any way.

I'm avoiding all of them, despite having multiple videos go viral.

Her scam on here is just the worst.

So I'm avoiding all that.

I'm sticking to the simple principles that work, that have always worked.

That's why I opened an OnlyFans account, because it's guaranteed money.

Being a stripper is always money, especially if you're well-endowed.

The only legitimate money I could find was that I could point a camera at.

TikTok is the same thing.

Because I can give so many speeches and talk for so long,

I might as well just point the camera at myself and tell how my day was on here.

Until I get in touch with the right people and find some sort of success on it.

So anyway, thank you.

So they just got the pool clean where I'm staying, but it's still a little cold.

So I'm not getting in. I'm waiting for the jacuzzi.

The sprinklers are sprinkling right on the jacuzzi.

So it's kind of out of bounds too.

But I had to put on this nose brace again because I'm snoring at night.

I can just tell I'm snoring and one of my nostrils is collapsed.

So it's causing me to snore.

And I don't know if there's some kind of surgery for that.

Like the three things I need are my nose fixed so it doesn't cause me to snore,

this jock itch fungal infection treated,

and my face acne actually resolved rather than me like trying to scrub it all

off, which hasn't worked.

So those are the three roadblocks I'm up against.

But sitting out by the pool, having it all to myself is pretty nice.

Like I said, they have two pools here, but only one of them is open right now.

They were both closed for cleaning for the past couple of days,

but they finally reopened one of them.

So I'm going to sit out here and come up with content to produce.

After scrubbing excessively,

I've been using some soap for this fungal infection.

I have new spots on my leg.

These weren't here before.

So in the few I showed on the other video,

so now I'm not going to get in the jacuzzi because I didn't have any visible

spots before, but now you can see I'm showing on my feet.

This one, that one's been there a while, but these other ones are new.

And I had been trying to not wear socks too much.

And like I said,

I've been scrubbing it with all sorts of over-the-counter products.

So I don't know. This has to be a winnable war.

I think people would flip out more about it if it was that serious.

But I'm having trouble with just over-the-counter remedies to resolve it.

So here's everything I'm using currently to treat this fungal infection.

You know, I showed most of them before,

but I have a new, two new additions.

I haven't tried this fungus soap and I also got this

Turbina Fine Hydrochloride and Fungi Clear,

Jock Itch Powder, Lotrimin, Emuate Max.

And then I'm also including Jack Daniel's Apple and Sam's Cola as part of the

medication and treatment required getting rid of this fungal infection.

So we'll see how it goes. Like I said, you know, I got new spots on my legs.

So I'm going to try with the new products. Hopefully I'll get some results.

Anyway, thank you.

Well, it looks like they got the Goodyear blimp flying around here for some reason.

I just saw it take off from North Las Vegas Airport.

I don't know where it's going if it's just for a special event.

I was thinking, you know, you can pile all the

aircraft into space travel and probably have something that makes progress.

You know, I don't know how much progress we're making just flying around back and forth everywhere,

but going to space is new. You know, it's a new thing.

It's for the old, like, Lewis and Clark explorers of the world, you know, that have never, you know,

a place a person has never been, space would be the next, like, continent to get to.

Um, and I know, like, Mars is getting closer and closer.

I've said on here before to avoid the moon entirely.

Um, I came up with that idea when I was at Kennedy Space Center sleeping in a tent nearby.

Going to the moon, you know, you move that thing around and it, like, disrupts the whole planet.

So everything on Earth is then shifted because the moon shifted if you park a bunch of junk up there.

So, uh, I came to the conclusion that just avoiding it entirely is better because it's,

it's not disrupting anything, you know, and, and the more you disrupt, the worse it is.

So the less disruption, the better, but Mars doesn't seem to have that problem.

So Mars is like wide open. Um, we should be, uh, uh, working harder to get a spaceship to Mars,

in my opinion, than anything to do with the moon or, or any of the moons, actually.

I don't know, you know, because we haven't gotten that far into space,

uh, I don't know what the rules would be. Like when we can actually get to other planets

and other solar systems, like what the rule system would be, potentially,

if there's life on other planets, you know, landed on the moon of other planets,

you're disrupting the whole planet. So that would be like a universal

rule of, of not going near the moon. So you don't disrupt the planet that it's, uh, orbiting.

Um, so that's just, as far as I got with that thought, it seems to avoid a lot of drama if

you just don't have anything to do with the moon in the first place. So that's my stance on it.

Um, but low earth orbit, geostationary orbit, uh, all the planets, you know, the asteroid belt,

you know, that's probably wide open and wouldn't cause any issues. So, and I looked at the asteroid

belt, you know, there's a lot of precious metals and me being from Nevada, the, um,

the precious metals, you know, there, there's a lot of mining rigs out here in Nevada that,

that you could probably use the same mindset to mine asteroids or potentially Mars, you know,

dig a hole in Mars to see what's down there. Um, and, uh, probably make some money. I can't

imagine we're that far off from having like orbiting space colonies, uh, with so many

rockets going up now, people are going to eventually just be up there. You know,

it's just going to happen. So, um, it's going to be interesting to watch to say the least.

Anyway. Thank you.

So, I think I've been drinking too much lately, uh, too much whiskey.

I've been drinking that Jack Daniels apple whiskey. And, uh, uh,

the funny part of it is it's got Jack Apple in it, you know?

And like, I'm not one for, for ripping off and stealing or anything,

but Jack Apple, you know, it makes me think of Apple computers and them.

Um, I, uh, I've always been on the window. Well, not always,

but mostly been on the window side of things. And, uh, you know,

I started out with Apple computers and kind of switched to windows.

I think it was flight simulator that started that. Um,

I don't know. Also, you know, being extremely poor, uh,

not being able to afford apples, you know, they cost considerably more.

So that was the other reason. But, uh, due to my drinking,

I have to make a public apology for recent comments I've made on multiple other

pages, uh, that may seem in poor taste.

So I, I'm making that public apology, uh,

and, uh, because, you know, I'm limited by being,

uh, uh, infected with jock itch and, uh,

from Nevada, I can't climb. You know,

if I try to climb too far, I get in trouble. Uh,

so I have to stick to my limits of how far I can climb.

And, uh, you know, Vegas seems to work pretty well for me. It works.

It worked well in the past.

So I'm hoping it works once I get through all this whiskey.

So anyway, thank you.

So I'm having more difficulty making videos in Vegas because it's so far lower

than Austin. You know,

it's really easy to get a camera working in Austin because millions of people

have cameras, you know, and it's, it's, uh, uh,

much more normal. Whereas Vegas, you know, it's a little different.

Everything's a surveillance camera and you're competing with, uh, uh,

all the casinos and, and, uh, uh, I guess resorts everywhere.

So I'm, I'm figuring out how to get this thing working in Nevada because there's

plenty of footage out here. You know, I'm from Nevada.

It's easy for me to come up with stories to show locations.

If I had transportation, you know, I don't have a car,

so I can't really go anywhere. But if I had transportation,

be easy to get footage to put on here, uh, that would be interesting. Um,

but getting this camera to fire the same way it did in Austin is more difficult.

You know, I can just sit on the side of the road and yell at a thing in Austin.

Uh, whereas here, you know, I, uh, I'm trying to be careful.

So I'm going through, you know,

I couldn't get the thing to start up until I went out and bought Jack Daniels,

Apple whiskey. And you know,

I don't know what the mechanism is in whiskey,

but the more you drink, the more you talk, at least that's how it works for me.

Um, so I'm trying to throttle how much whiskey I need to drink to be able to

talk.

So I just had a few sips of it now and got the whole thing working again.

I don't know if it's like, um, uh,

kind of a mental state you get in when you have a few sips of whiskey. Uh,

but, uh, it's easier to talk with it, that's for sure.

And all I'm doing now is talking. Uh, so it,

it seems to be helping this taste incredible, by the way, this, um,

Jack Daniels, Apple whiskey plus, uh,

diet caffeine free, uh, Sam's Cola,

I think is what I'm mixing with it and it tastes great. Uh,

so it just tastes like Apple Coke whiskey, um, which is really good.

So I'm going to keep like trying to come up with footage ideas and upload them

on here, uh, as much as possible. Anyway, thank you.

Apparently I need to get therapy. I don't have a way to get therapy. It's not that

I'm refusing or resisting, but I physically don't have transportation to

go to a therapist. That's what I'm going through today. I think it's

just a sign-off. I need a sign-off to prove that I'm physically sane and

coherent and capable. But because I don't have transportation, I can't go to one.

I tried multiple therapists and the nearest one is in Henderson that

had availability and I don't have transportation to get to Henderson to

go to the therapist. I'll go to therapy as many times as

required until whatever issue is resolved. But having the physical

lack of transportation is the issue. Part of the reason I don't have

transportation in the first place is I was starting to get witched around all

over the place. So I'd start just driving around aimlessly all over the

country and that went on until I went bankrupt and then ended up

stranded on the side of the road. So that's what caused the issue with

transportation in the first place. I don't know what was motivating me to

coast around the country, but I went all over the United States. I think it

was every state except for Delaware and Rhode Island. But I went to every

state in the country just sleeping in the back of a van. I don't know what

caused the motivation for that. I could not ground myself for anything. I could

not just anchor down enough to stay put anywhere. I think partially, you know,

I completely switched systems I was operating under. So I switched from

whatever outlaw mess my parents created to a event staff system. You know, the

event staff system, it's almost a cop. You know, you're not a cop but everyone

thinks you're one. So switching from that outlaw system to this not a cop but

everyone thinks you're a cop system ripped up all my roots. So I couldn't

like go back to being anchored down to the system I was using before and that

caused me to just coast around not finding a place for myself all over the

country. So that's what caused the the big issue I had of not being able to

stay still anywhere. And I still have a little bit of that problem now. You know,

I'll pace around the apartment complex a little bit. It's not bad. I'm more just

taking, you know, I'll take a morning walk. But it's not it's not excessive and

that's just for exercise to be seen by everyone and to be able to socialize as

much as possible. But I can see it now with how I walk. You know, I don't have

enough of a set course of when I go out and walk I need a set destination. Go to

that destination and then walk back. See, if I upgrade that to a car, you know, I

need to make sure I have a set destination. Go to that destination and

then come straight back. Not like drift around and wander around everywhere.

Which is what happened the first time. And I don't know, I think I was just, I

don't know if I was getting scared or if I wanted to keep myself entertained and

that was the most entertaining way to be was just drift around. But now I don't

want anything to do with it. You know, I don't want to travel anywhere. I like it

here. I liked it in Austin too, but Austin wasn't working out. I couldn't, I

couldn't make enough money. I wasn't from Texas. So being from Nevada, you know, I

have a much bigger excuse to be here. Whereas in Texas, like no one knew why I

was there in the first place. Like, you know, you immediately think, you know, I

got in some fight or something, got ran off and then there were people after me

in Nevada. Whereas when I'm sitting in Nevada in the first place, it doesn't

create that phobia for others that, you know, what am I running from. So this

works pretty well. I'm trying to alleviate as much doubt as possible with

other people so they have the minimal amount of doubts about me that I'm gonna

be supportive and helpful and and they're, you know, not wandering off

somewhere. So that's that's what I'm working on now and I'm gonna I'm gonna

keep trying to find a therapist just so I can get that sign off from a therapist

proving, you know, I it's it's kind of like a certification, you know, proving I

passed their mental evaluation. So anyway, thank you.

So my drinking has gotten out of control.

This was the problem the first time.

I'm up to like a fifth of Jack Daniels a day in Las Vegas.

And the first time I was in Vegas in my 20s, this is why I left.

I didn't want to drink so much, so I left the city to stop drinking.

When I was in Austin, I didn't drink at all.

You know, it was the non-issue.

The second I'm in Las Vegas, it's drinking all day, every day, which is a pain.

I'm from Nevada, so I apparently have to be here because I'm from here.

So the whiskey drinking is the downside to being in Nevada, whereas in Texas it wasn't an issue.

I have to be close to my mom because I have to be close to living family, so I have to be in Vegas.

But, you know, it's an absurd amount of drinking in the city.

And I can't find another way to like physically be here.

So, like I said, you know, I'm from Winnemucca originally, but it never went well.

Vegas did succeed, except for drinking constantly.

So when I was in my 20s, you know, I got to bars and drink, but now the thing's so dead that I'm just drinking at the hotel room.

And it's absurd. It's very leaving Las Vegas-esque.

Minus the hooker. You know, the hooker's not there, but the rest of it is leaving Las Vegas.

So it's just me drinking in a hotel room all day every day for no reason.

It doesn't even make any sense because everywhere else I was in the country, I didn't need to drink at all.

I would just walk around and tell my life story.

But the second I'm physically in Las Vegas, it's alcohol all day every day for no reason.

So I'm trying to get my foot in the door in Fontainebleau or whatever its French Canada name is and see what works there.

Because Winnemucca wants me to be a car dealer, and the only game I know how to deal is Texas Hold'em.

So I was talking to car dealers at Fontainebleau or whatever the name of the damn thing is.

I was talking to car dealers there to see if there's employment available because it's a big, new, beautiful casino.

And that thing is spectacular. I got to give it credit. It is absolutely spectacular.

I didn't take a camera with me when I was there, but Vegas is amazing at building resorts.

The reason I love this city is its ability to build a resort is second to none.

I was looking at the Burj Khalifa in Dubai and I don't know if it competes because there's no gaming or nightlife as much in Dubai.

But in Vegas, that Fontainebleau is the reason I was here in the first place.

It is absolutely beautiful and everything that draws me to Vegas in the first place.

Anyway, thank you.

So I'm still working on OnlyFans, but I've run out of ideas.

I think I'm better at giving speeches than doing adult entertainment,

but because I'm well-endowed, you know, it's, it's the direction, you know,

I should be in. I shouldn't say have to be in,

but should be in just because that's where everything works. There's this whole,

I'm going through this like pool saga of, you know,

pools I can be in and pools I can't and not trying to step on

anyone's toes. So, uh,

working in adult entertainment doesn't seem to step on anyone's toes and it does

pay. I just have to get good at it. You know, I don't know how to dance. Um,

I was in music, uh, for a while,

but, uh, that doesn't seem to be carrying over that well. So, uh,

learning how to dance is the biggest hindrance I'm having now,

which, you know,

just putting up dancing videos on OnlyFans would probably make some money.

Uh, but, uh, my,

my very basic ability to dance isn't holding very well. And just, you know,

general ideas of content to put up there, uh,

is what's slowing me down, but I'm going to keep working at it. Um, it's, uh,

it works great in Vegas. You know, it's, it's speaking Vegas's language,

uh, having OnlyFans going strong.

So I'm going to keep working on it and, uh, see how it goes. Anyway.

Thank you.

So I drank myself out of whiskey. I'm completely out of whiskey and I don't

want to, I don't have enough to buy another fifth because it would get in

the way of my food budget. So I'm maintaining a basic minimal food budget

but have run completely out of whiskey. So I'm out of Jack and Cokes for the

time being. I'm just sitting around the hotel room. I was gonna walk around a

little but haven't decided what to do. I ended up deleting all the Doom games

off my laptop and I don't know if that was a good idea or not. I removed it

because it wasn't working very well in Vegas. In Austin, you know, Doom went like

crazy. Like you could play Doom all day every day because the game developers

are from Dallas, Texas. So it's right down the street from Austin. So they're

really promoting Doom over there. But in Vegas it didn't seem to do as well. So I

ended up deleting it to just make more room for video storage on the laptop

because I'm doing so much content creation on TikTok, Instagram, and OnlyFans

that having all the video space available possible seemed to be more

valuable than having ten old Doom games on there taking up a bunch of space

because my laptop doesn't have a lot of storage. So doing a lot of videos eats up

the storage quickly on the laptop. And I'm using it for editing. I used to edit

on the cell phone but once I got that Microsoft ClipChamp working correctly

it is incredibly better than editing on the cell phone. So I can get it down to

like microscopic, down to the frame of where I want the segues to be and where

I want the beginning and end to be, which is much better. So the laptop has proved

its worth for editing. I was using it for writing too. I wrote 65 pages of a

book into it but I don't know what happened. This was on the Chromebook and

I don't know what happened to that book but it got deleted somehow and I only

got 65 pages in. So I may have to rewrite the whole thing at some point. It was a

shame. You know, I wish I was able to save that. It was just me rambling about my

life story, exactly what I'm doing on here, but in written text form to see if

there would be any way to put it together into a screenplay and make

money having a conventional film put together. But you know that one somehow

got deleted so it's gone. I don't know. I may or I probably need a conventional

writer to write my story down and then try to market it to people. Or multiple

stories. You know, I have a thousand stories saved away because this is my

legacy has not had a camera on it ever. So no one's ever told their story from

my entire family's history ever. So there's a lot, you know, going on that has

a lot of stories that have never been told and no one's ever seen or heard

anything about it. And some are interesting, some are not. You know,

there might be a few that will sell pretty well. So anyway, thank you.

So I'm in Las Vegas. I'm sitting on a whopping $45.

You know, this is total, total cash I have.

Uh, I don't know, you know,

I'm still working on OnlyFans and I'm still, uh,

working on TikTok and content creation,

but I'm not seeing a lot of cash out of it.

So I'm kind of browsing around, uh,

casinos to see because I'm from Winnemucca, Nevada,

um, Las Vegas, Nevada, isn't very far off,

but I'm kind of a lean Nevada guy.

Um, the Las Vegas guys are much bigger and stronger than I am.

You know, I still fall under the nerd category.

I know because I'm working on OnlyFans, uh,

that's kind of getting sorta into the stripper thing,

but it's not far enough to earn enough cash.

Um, just because I was a nerd, you know,

I was a computer nerd for so long that, uh,

that's where my money used to come from. But because I'm well endowed,

as I've said before, all my relationships would blow up.

Like they would just,

they were all based on fetish and they would separate instantly.

Um, the second there was an issue.

So there was like no foundation for them to run on, uh,

to be able to continue. Um,

so that's why I did this gigantic reversal on everything I ever was,

um, to get, you know,

personal connections to actually hold and be stable,

um, to be able to rely on them,

which is what the issue was before. Cause I guess the entire time I was doing,

uh, IT, um,

I was just being a stripper the whole time, you know, and, uh, they were,

they were making me think I could, uh,

fix computers when it was just being a stripper because I'm well endowed and

that's all the, uh, that's all the real motive was.

Um, so this was during my twenties and that's when that party went so gigantic

that, uh, it, uh,

caused everything I'd ever owned to cave in on me.

So I'm working on community and I'm working on support and mostly working on

ways to make cash in Las Vegas.

So my real shortage is cash. Um,

anything that pays I'm going for. So anyway, thank you.

So every once in a while it does rain here. It hasn't hit the ground very much, but you

can see the clouds. I haven't seen much lightning or anything. It's just been kind of windy.

I think in the late summer there's monsoons that sort of come through here, and they have

a bunch of washway tunnels under the city. I've only been in a few of them. I don't know

why. I used to have a Suzuki DRZ400 Black Widow. I had street plates for it and everything,

but it was mostly a dirt bike. It was great for riding around in those tunnels. Now where

I was, I was on the very outskirts of the city, and it was just kind of empty dirt bike

area, so I don't think I would have gotten in much trouble, if any, for riding around

in those tunnels. But they were quite a bit of fun, because you could race around underground

on a dirt bike. So I don't know if that would have been considered a violation or not. I

never got in trouble for it. I ended up riding that DRZ all over the West Coast. I bought

a fifth-wheel hitch for my truck and a fifth-wheel trailer, and then hauled that DRZ all over

the West Coast, and rode it all over the place. But I ended up selling everything in my mass

sell-off. Selling off everything and donating everything I couldn't sell when I left Vegas

the first time. Now because everything is so small, I don't know how to re-approach

this situation. But trying a new angle on Vegas, with keeping a camera on me at all

times, and producing whatever content I can possibly come up with on here, to earn a living.

So that's my new angle. The old one was doing IT, doing server repair and workstation repair,

stuff like that. So this is a completely new approach. We'll see how it goes. Anyway, thank

you.

So I only made 25 bucks on Oath last week, but next week looks like it's going to be a hundred, so

I'll have a few more bucks. I have money for rent in my PayPal, but I zeroed out the other two,

so cash half is like two dollars, and Venmo is, I don't know, five dollars.

So I'm not finding whiskey, which is probably a good thing. My teeth are getting really sore

from whiskey. You know, I haven't been able to see a dentist, so I'm just

brushing a lot to try to keep them intact as long as possible, and so my teeth are too sore for

whiskey, but it was helping me get to sleep at night, you know. A few Jack and Cokes and could

fall asleep. Now, you know, without it, I'm back to the same cycle I was in before where I try to

fall asleep at 10, you know, just like everyone in the world, and get woken up or can't settle

down enough to fall asleep, and so I'm back to this cycle again, which I have yet to be able

to resolve. I don't want any sleep aids because they seem to make things worse, you know. It goes

back to just might as well stick with whiskey because anything that, any pills you take,

I think are harder on you than just alcohol, you know, because alcohol is so common that

it doesn't seem to cause these lasting health issues like the very heavy sleeping aids do, so

I'm just going to walk around, you know. I'm working on health and fitness, and

so I can probably shed a few pounds anyway and be okay. It might do me a favor.

So it just may make more money on oath, which is what's really straining me. The system at

Budget Suites, why I'm staying here in the first place, is really simple. It just runs on the

simple who's paying system, so it automatically, like you think automatically who's paying, and

then you go in that direction. So that's really what I'm after. Because I don't have

transportation, I can't go anywhere. I'm eyeing Fountain Blue, just walking around there a few

times to see if I can get my foot in the door in anything. Because I spent two years in Florida in

a tent, that's a lot of Florida. You know, I was in Florida a long time, and there's a Fountain

Blue Miami, which is this old gigantic resort that's been there for a long time, and it's

really well known and just a very big respected resort in Miami. So because I'm from Nevada,

you know, I have a little bit of a boost here. And getting into Fountain Blue Las Vegas,

plus all my Florida experience, might turn into some kind of success. I don't know, you know,

when I think about Winnemucca, the only message I ever got from my dad was he thought I was a

card dealer in Vegas the whole time. And that got me thinking, maybe they want me to be a card dealer.

So I was, I talked to one of the Texas Hold'em dealers at Fountain Blue when I was there the

first time. Because I have most of it down, I can mostly deal Texas Hold'em. And that might

appease everyone. I don't know, I'm just gonna keep telling my life story into this camera and see

what comes through. It's worked thus far. Anyway, thank you.

So I'm still single, and I've been going through everything I did in Vegas the first time,

including working here again now in a different industry, and how I was just kind of jumping

in bed with any woman that showed up. That kind of cascaded out of control to the point

where I had to bail on the city. So if I was a little more exclusive or selective, it probably

wouldn't cause that problem. But I can see myself having the same issue now, because

I don't have a car at all. So getting down to the Strip is impossible, and I want to

go down to the Strip more than I am. So it turns into that, well, you know, if you give

me a ride down to the Strip, we'll hang out for a while. And I don't know if that's what

causes the cascade of sleeping around too much, and causing me to wash out of everything

over and over again. So I'm re-going through everything I did in my 20s, trying to tell

all the stories about it. I have a million stories from my life that could probably be

put together into a book or movie, or multiple movies, or multiple books. But I'm just not

good enough of a writer or film producer to be able to put the whole thing together. I

did write like 65 pages or 59 pages of a book that I posted online. I've posted the link

to it in a few comments. Everyone asked me about a book. I'll try to post a link to it

here. But it's just kind of a hodgepodge of short stories that don't really add up. You

know, I need actual writing ability to be able to put something together, or to get

an actual writer to put the thing together to be something coherent that people would

enjoy reading. Because I know there's a lot of people here that want to listen to my backstory,

which is extensive. A lot of parties, a lot of traveling around, a lot of big spectacles.

Like I was in a plane crash, used to race around on motorcycles. I had a bunch of sport

bikes, had a bunch of sports cars. Traveled around, you know, lived in the back of a van

for a year and a half, driving around all over the country. Went to 48 of 50 of the

states. I don't want to travel at all anymore. I like Vegas. I like parking myself. I liked

Austin too, but I just couldn't quite make enough money in Austin, so I moved to Vegas.

Because Vegas seems to be more profitable. What seemed to cause that is South by Southwest

in Austin didn't do as well as it normally does, and Vegas is just flourishing. So it

just turned into an auto move back to Vegas. So that's why I'm here now. Now trying to

make the most of it at 43. You know, when I moved here the first time when I was 23,

and had a huge, gigantic party for 7 years, 8 years. So moving here when I'm 43, I'm

trying to re-evaluate how to handle this because I am single, never married, no kids. Trying

to find when the right woman comes along, we'll happily get married, have kids, and

go through all of that. But I still haven't met the right woman, and not having transportation

go down to the strip just makes it to where whoever shows up, then I just end up with

them. And it lasts like 5 minutes, and it's never a functioning relationship. And that's

probably what caused the issues I had in the past, is just jumping on whatever ship showed

up. So I'm going to keep trying to re-evaluate and see what works. Anyway, thank you!

This is my life. Or what's left of it, anyway. Started with a hundred-dollar bill outside a gas station in Florida after three years of being on the street. A hundred bucks. Most guys buy booze. Joe (@guynamedjoe1 on TikTok) bought a tablet. Sixty dollars at Walmart. The cheapest thing with a screen and a camera. That's how you climb out of the pit. You start with a sixty-dollar tablet and yell into it. See who’s listening.

It’s all about systems. Breaking systems, getting stuck in them, trying to game them. Joe (@guynamedjoe1 on TikTok)'s old life? IT. Network administrator, systems analyst. Ten years. DeVry, the whole bit. It caved in on him. Partying. Drinking. Dealing with stress and sleep. The systems collapse. Then you’re standing on the side of the road.

But the real system failure? The family baggage. Three generations of it. Undocumented money. Potential crime. Landed on Joe (@guynamedjoe1 on TikTok). They never told their story. Now he’s telling his. Typing it into a laptop. Got about fifty pages. Sixty-five once, but it got deleted. It’s a long saga. Digging himself out of this pit. It blocks everything. Social welfare, jobs. Feels like he went bankrupt just trying to explain it.

And then there's the other thing. The complication. The defining feature that jams everything up. The endowment. Joe (@guynamedjoe1 on TikTok) has to say it. Over and over. Like it’s some kind of disclaimer. So no surprises. Especially if he’s trying to date someone. It automatically shoves him into the "adult entertainment category". Not the "nerd category". Even though he likes computers and science and space. It’s the curse of having a big dick. Causes drama. Friends of girls wanting to "try it out". Cascading interpersonal complications. It’s why Joe (@guynamedjoe1 on TikTok) even thinks about OnlyFans. Sometimes it feels like the only door this opens.

The face doesn’t help. All chewed up. Acne, boils. Swelling. Joe (@guynamedjoe1 on TikTok) has to scratch it to get the swelling out. Been like this for years. Hard to get a job. Hard to feel desirable. Then the fungal thing. Twenty years fighting it. Prescription creams, sprays. Bought a new $63 tube the other day. Only made $400 this month. All that money goes to fighting this. Used to call it a "fungal shell". A kind of armor. Taking it off stirs deep anxiety. Leaves Joe (@guynamedjoe1 on TikTok) vulnerable. To illness and emotional distress.

Joe (@guynamedjoe1 on TikTok) tried going to the hospital for it. Children’s hospital, only one he knew. They quoted $299. He didn’t have the money, so he left. They billed him $500 or $800 anyway. For treatment he never got. That’s the kind of gear he gets jammed up in. This is potentially contagious. But he can’t pay to get it proven. How do you… what do you do?

Everything’s a fight. Money’s a fight. Health is a fight. Sleep is a fight. Getting work? Jam up city. Conventional jobs fumble after a few months. Being well endowed limits Joe (@guynamedjoe1 on TikTok)'s possibilities. People get uncomfortable. Makes workplaces awkward. He even thought about being a cop. But being well-endowed would wreak havoc on a police department.

So Joe (@guynamedjoe1 on TikTok) is stuck. Bogged down. Until this investigation gets resolved. The investigation into his own life. Trying to explain everything. So no questions. So he doesn’t get falsely accused. So people know exactly where he’s been, exactly what he’s been doing. Trying to unravel what his parents created safely. It’s harder than he thought. This pile of baggage is burying him. Everything’s stifled. He can sit here, same level, but he can’t really do anything.

So he just tells his story. Into the camera. Unfiltered. See what happens. It works, kind of. Got him temporary housing. Got him to Austin. Joe (@guynamedjoe1 on TikTok) likes Austin. Austin's been good. Helped pull him out of being homeless. But the systems are different here than Vegas. More throttled back. More rules.

It's a constant hustle. Trying to turn a profit. Telling his story profitably. Needs more writing lessons. Or a professional writer. Or someone to proofread. Trying to learn how film production works. Going through a crash course. Rehearsing what to say. Trying to be interesting. It’s pretty difficult. Operating the whole thing. Trying to come up with new content. While Joe (@guynamedjoe1 on TikTok) is just standing here. Jammed up. Waiting. For his face to clear. For the jock itch to go away. For the money to come in. For the next idea.

Anyway. Stay tuned.

# Joe Archive

A growing archive of transcripts, analysis, and insights inspired by [Joe](https://www.tiktok.com/@GuyNamedJoe1) — a creator sharing raw, thoughtful reflections on life, technology, and survival after homelessness.

This project exists to better understand Joe’s story, highlight recurring themes in his content, and encourage others to support his journey.
